"A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public.



“I’ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people’s business.”

He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesn’t care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors.

Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of “confidential,” “secret” and “top secret” by commenting that “there’s classified and then there’s classified” were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so.

A reporter with first-hand knowledge sums up Obama’s “transparent” government, “Obama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon.”

A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency;

“My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.”

Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obama’s campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until 2011.

He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface.

Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth.

Obama lied about his support FOR same-sex marriage before announcing his support for it in 2012. “Yet if Obama’s views were ‘evolving’ publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors,” Axelrod writes. “The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed.
Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the 2008 campaign. “No one got under Barack’s skin more than Maureen … He was patronizing and disrespectful.” This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod.
“Obama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public: The president called Axelrod a “mother—–r” and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the president’s debating techniques as Obama prepared for his 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney” says Axelrod.
While those incidents speak to Obama’s two-faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies;

Lie: Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House.

Truth: In September 2012, an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Iran’s nuclear installations.

Lie: In May 2011, Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was “basically complete.”

Truth: The Department of Homeland Security admits just 36.3 miles or 5% of the border is fenced.

Lie: Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare.

Truth: A March 2012 edict from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion.

Ben Rhodes was Obama’s partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration; the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.”

He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story; “In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt.

Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In 2006, Risen published “State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration.” Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers.

Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories; “Well, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they don’t like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington.”

Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In 2009, Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in 2014 speech he told reporters; “Here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.”

In 2010, despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling.

Finally in January of 2015, after 7 years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won.

Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obama’s years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change.

A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama;

“He promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the government’s misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels.”",How Obama Used The DOJ To Destroy A Reporter’s Life And Blanket Full Immunity Over Clinton,Fake
"Donald Trump was promised a smooth and respectful transition by President Barack Obama, but it’s been anything but. Obama’s massive ego and thin skin now has him publicly degrading Trump’s landslide Electoral College victory and diligently working behind the scenes to thwart the will of the people.

Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office with Donald Trump about one month ago and vowed to do his best to foster a peaceful transition of power and to carry out the desire of the American people. Those lofty sentiments turned snarky quickly when it came time for Obama to start packing up his belongings and vacate the people’s house.

Over the course of the past month, Obama added a record number of new regulations across a myriad of federal agencies that try to control our lives – and livelihoods. In the past few days, he surpassed his own record and likely isn’t done trying to curtail President-Elect Trump’s authority after he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N. Security Council from attempting to create a “two-state solution” between Israel and the Palestinians by demanding that settlement building in disputed areas cease immediately.

Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than 2,000 new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement – regardless of the risks to national security.

President Obama had heralded George W. Bush’s commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself.

First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really don’t matter to liberals.

Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self-involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop Trump’s agenda from passing—thanks to Harry Reid’s short-sighted pushing for the “nuclear option.”

Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January 20 – nor will they succeed in pushing his oath-taking ceremony inside. The efforts of #Disrupt20 protesters will fail just as surely as Jill Stein’s recount endeavors.

If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President-Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!","BREAKING – Trump DEFIES Obama, Tells Americans What Obama is Doing Behind the Scenes",Fake
"Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition (Britain and France included) recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound. 

Erdogan’s bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality:

“They [the U.S.] give support to terrorist groups including Daesh (IS/ISIL). We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.”

While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence.

Adding to the disclosure was Iran’s Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan:

The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We don’t see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because it’s them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world.”

Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many:

“If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its’ citizens.” 

What is most interesting about Erdogan’s comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of 2015.

So, perhaps Turkey (or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey) have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the “Turkish Stream” pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be “intensifying cooperation” between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking/political cabal. Time will tell. 

It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL: Time is short.

Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo (the biggest battle to date), but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months. 

Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next. ",Turkey’s Erdogan Says U.S. Supports ISIL: ‘We Have Evidence With Pictures & Videos’,Fake
"On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials — including Secretary of State John Kerry — and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove Israel’s accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti-Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council.

According to the Times of Israel:

At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure.

In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, Israel’s Channel 1 TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al-Youm Al-Sabea newspaper.

Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian Authority’s General Intelligence Service.

Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders.

According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has “ironclad” proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti-settlement resolution.

“We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,” said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration:

Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration.

“We will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it,” Dermer told CNN.

According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by Israel’s side during the vote, it “was behind this ganging up on Israel at the UN”.

Jeff Dunetz noted:

Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two-state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti-Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. 15 that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel-hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution.

The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them.

At the end of the meeting, the report said,  Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late.

The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution.

“We did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote,” Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday.",Egyptian paper: Transcript proves Kerry plotted UN resolution against Israel with Palestinians — Report,Fake

Middle class voters are Republican Trump voters.
Obama just sealed the deal with his anti-white racism.

The map below shows how Obama lost working class white voters in every state since taking office except for Vermont and Massachusetts.

Democrats may have lost the white working class vote for generations.
It’s Obama’s fault.

And just this week Barack Obama was out again railing against white working class Americans for his party’s woes.
iPatriot reported:

Obama also blamed Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the NRA for distracting the country from his message of “hope and change”, particularly during the holiday season.

“If we’re not actually out there changing the narrative like we are during campaigns, then folks in a lot of these communities, what they’re hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns,” he said. ” Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities.” Ah yes, the problem was you couldn’t mindlessly brainwash the country Barack, not that your message was fundamentally anti-American.

Obama defended the robbers and hosted Black Lives Matter in the White House.

The Black Lives matter led to several police deaths, lootings and burned businesses.

"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. He’s been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says he’s got irrefutable evidence.

His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so-called “freedom fighters” or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing Obama’s terrorist allies in the past. It’s more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive.

It’s beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the “legitimizing factor” for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non-existent moderate freedom fighters.

Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has “confirmed evidence” that US-led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that “it’s very clear” the US is supporting ISIS. He said, “They were accusing us of supporting Daesh (ISIS). Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. It’s very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.” YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey.

Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, ”The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they don’t, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on.”

Erdogan complained “They are supporting all the terror groups — the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh (ISIS)  It’s quite clear, perfectly obvious,” he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging “the West stands by Daesh (ISIS) right now” and its weapons were Western-made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection.

He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If he’s got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, it’s already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him.",urkey President Claims Has Video Evidence Obama Is Supporting ISIS,Fake
"Finding a performer for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has not been easy, because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horses.

Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on America’s Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! (via Breitbart)

Evancho’s 2011 “Dream With Me” album and her 2010 “O Holy Night” are both sitting at No. 2 on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl!

For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place.

“I have recently been asked by the President-elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing-in ceremony at the inauguration,” Evancho stated. “I’m so excited. It’s going to be awesome.” At least someone has some American pride.

But liberals, of course, aren’t about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evancho’s family.

“My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us,” Evancho claimed. “But I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it.”

So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views.

At 16, Jackie Evancho’s list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her “O Holy Night EP” made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. 1 Classical Albums Artist of 2011.

As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trump’s inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.

Liberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers, and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening. The truth is, Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they can’t get their way.","WHOA – Liberals Attacked Trump Inauguration Singer, But They Got KNOCKED OUT by America!",Fake

"Once, Harry Reid pushed through “the nuclear option” to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress.

He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican-controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of 51 votes and not the super majority which requires 60 votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes.

Harry Reid’s nuclear option requiring only 51 votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate – which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President-Elect Donald Trump’s agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course.

Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, Trump’s agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote!

At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry Reid’s urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in “unprecedented obstruction.”

Apparently saying “NO!” to  economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do – which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid.

“If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, that’s their decision and they will have to live with it,” Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it.

Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has “absolutely no regret,” over Reid’s nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesn’t appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option.

Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan.

One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option. They ignored his wise words as well, and totally ignored the big picture when placing their votes.

“Democrats won’t be in power in perpetuity. This is a mistake — a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate tremendously in a bad way,” Senator Shelby said before the vote was taken in 2013.

Following both the text and the spirit of the Constitution while putting America and Americans first, would only be considered a radical concept by Liberals who have sipped far too much of the Kool-Aid handed out by the members of the politically correct far-left contingent in Washington.

"It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all. It’s just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats can’t do any job right.

Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un-recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News.

Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand.

Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, 87 of the machines’ optical scanners broke on election day.

When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again.

The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that “in many cases, [they] failed to do so.” What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times?

Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two-thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought.

There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his District’s elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, “Penny’s precinct, Detroit Precinct #152, had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right?”

“Well, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? 304 no, 299 nope, 200 nada, how about 100 wrong again. There were only exactly 50 paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have 306. HMMMM.” Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance.

If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff.

In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.

The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trump’s hands.

“Look at those hands, are they small hands?” Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. “And he [Rubio] referred to my hands, ‘if they’re small something else must be small.’ I guarantee you there’s no problem, I guarantee it.”

Donald Trump's penis size
A screenshot of Donald Trump’s tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted.
“He’s always calling me Little Marco. And I’ll admit he’s taller than me,” Rubio told ABC News. “He’s like 6’2, which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5’2,” Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. “And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can’t trust them.”

The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years.

As Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter recalled online last year: “Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a ‘short-fingered vulgarian’ in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn’t surprised by Trump’s actions.

“Donald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people,” Bradley said. “We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’.



“Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. I’m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil’s playground for good,” Cruz said. “I’m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it’s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.”

Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.

“Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t. To be honest, I don’t know a lot about this subject matter. I don’t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and she’s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.”

This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “Right to stimulate one’s genitals.” Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “A new belief of his”, implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story.

“All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldn’t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. It’s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one’s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can’t do it anymore, then no one can.”



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.

“It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President,” Bradley said. “With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.” Bradley continued, “Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.”

Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. “When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, they’re big enough to handle it.”

Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.

RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a “no-brainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.

“Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.”

"New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,” NYPD sources told True Pundit.

NYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.

The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.

But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:

Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes
NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.

“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”

The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.

“People are going to prison,” he said.

Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.

“If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said.

NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.

Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.

The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.

Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches

According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner’s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.

Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.

At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clinton’s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner’s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.

However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton’s closest personal aide, weren’t the only people with access to the Weiner’s email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedin’s sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiner’s email account, FBI sources confirmed.

FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedin’s emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.

According to FBI sources, the bureau’s newly-minted probe into Clinton’s use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:

Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner’s email
Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.
Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records
Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents
A private consultant managed Weiner’s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain’s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.
Because Weiner’s campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiner’s server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.

Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didn’t know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.

Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.

Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.

Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBI’s 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.

But now, all that has changed, with the FBI’s decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptop’s emails.","BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation, Pay to Play, Perjury",Fake

"While blasting so-called “fake news” on Thursday, Hillary Clinton once again wore the color purple which signifies George Soros’ color revolution against the Donald Trump presidency.
Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. 9.
Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in 1992, has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa.
And now he’s trying to do the same using far-left radicals in the U.S., if Hillary’s recent penchant for the color purple is any indication.
But why purple? It’s the color resulting from mixing red and blue – and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming “purple revolution” will likely justify it as the “unification” of the divided red and blue states of America.
“Anytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue,” reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. “On the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the ‘Moonie’ Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple.”
“Mrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie.”
Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros-funded activist group MoveOn.org.
“When it comes to themed revolutions, the Sorosites have refined the art to a science,” Madsen added. “While Mrs. Clinton called for uniting the nation in her concession speech, Soros’s minions took the streets in protests, some turning violent, across the United States.”

"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the 22nd Amendment. Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at Maryland’s National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, “I’m not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.”

Citing “poor performance” on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels “obligated” to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis “just like Roosevelt.”

“This is not something out of the ordinary,” says political analyst Elliot Stabler. “We already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.”

In addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.

The Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States. Since ratification there have been several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment.

"CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.

“If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country,” warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. “What we’ve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.”

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesn’t factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. “Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens,” Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the country’s ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. “Mexicans -as we’ve seen over the last quarter century – have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada,” said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. “These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.”

Garcia’s data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. “These people aren’t simply disappearing,” said Garcia. “On the contrary, they’re coming to the United States.”",New Study Shows Illegal Immigrants to Outnumber Americans 2 to 1 by 2025,Fake
"WASHINGTON DC – On Monday afternoon, an extremist carried out an attack on Capitol Hill, shooting and injuring a police officer. The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.



When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitor’s center, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.
“All I heard was ‘[expletive removed] Obama! [expletive removed] liberals and ISIS! Make America great again!” John Burke, a college student visiting the visitors center stated to ABC News. “Then we heard gun shots and were immediately instructed to leave the building.”



Thomas Finnigan is a 32 year old white supremacist linked towards having a strong affinity for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on his Facebook. He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.
“It’s concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest,” ABC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. “While in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population.

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission – the federal agency which oversees state and national elections – said that Facebook’s revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. “We aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018,” Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “In a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook.” Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for Facebook’s innovative voting platform. “In the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel,” vowed Zuckerberg. “Wherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.”",Mark Zuckerberg: America Will Elect Its Next President via Facebook,Fake
"MOSCOW, Ru. – During an extravagant ceremony at the Kremlin on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he has appointed American actor and martial arts expert Steven Seagal to serve as Tsar of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by the Russian Federation in March of 2014.

Dubbed “Steven the Great” by Mr. Putin, the sixty-four year-old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans. Featuring a breathtaking panoramic view of the Black Sea, the royal residence once served as a summer retreat for Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.

“This is a momentous day, not just for the people of Crimea, but for all Russians,” proclaimed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during an appearance on the state-run news network Russia Today. “Steven the Great is a legendary martial artist with an extensive background in firearms and marksmanship. Furthermore, he is more proficient and possesses far greater experience in hand-to-hand combat, counter-terrorism operations, and crime fighting than any man on earth excluding His Excellency President Putin.”

The prime minister later said Putin has the utmost confidence in Seagal’s ability to rule Crimea, calling the star of Hard to Kill a “firm but gentle leader” who is “well versed in the art of paternalism.” To drive the point home, Putin will hand over command of Russian forces in Crimea – including the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol – to Mr. Seagal upon his arrival at Livadia Palace later this week.

Steven Seagal, who has appeared in a number of martial arts-style action films including Above the Law, On Deadly Ground, and Exit Wounds, was awarded Russian citizenship last Thursday by President Vladimir Putin, who issued a special decree honoring the actor.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.”

Under the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision.

“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn’t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.”

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.”

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.”

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

“[The electoral college] is a f—king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and that’s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It’s time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.”

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,” Obama said. “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.”

"Calling it a 'total disaster', president-elect Donald Trump pledged in a video clip posted on YouTube today that he will scrap Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative on his first day in office.

Launched in 2010 with a mission to combat childhood obesity by promoting exercise and improving access to healthier food choices for children in underserved communities, Let's Move has failed to achieve any of its goals, the president-elect claims.

""It's a total disaster. A complete joke. Kids today are fatter than ever,"" Trump said. ""Maybe vegetables make you fat. Who knows? We're going to look into it.""

Trump indicated his administration would replace the campaign with one that promotes jobs and economic growth.

""These kids don't need to play, they need jobs. Nobody's going to pay anyone to play hopscotch,"" he remarked. ""And not only is working a great form of exercise, it will help their parents pay the bills.""

"The American President-elect Donald Trump has officially announced this morning that Sarah Palin is to become the new Science and Technology Adviser.

Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah Palin’s strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet.
“God killed the dinosaurs”

Some scientists openly fear that Sarah Palin could be the end of the science establishment as we know it and would relegate the Office of Science and Technology “to the dark ages”.

“I mean, this is scary as hell” explains climatologist Dan B. Evans from the University of California, Berkeley.

“The woman claimed in an interview in 2009 that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth,” he warned, visibly concerned.

“With Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la-la land” he adds.

A scientific community in disbelief

Sarah Palin’s strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles.

In a 2009 UN statement that acknowledged that 97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, “the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd” and called the 2007 IPCC report a “load of rubbish” and a “fraud”.

“With irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy 33% in the next ten years” has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.

Environmentalists fear the worst as President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Pact, potentially dealing a death blow to the whole accord by refuting the international consensus on climate change, believe experts.","SARAH PALIN APPOINTED AS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVISER, PROMISES TO GET RID OF CLIMATE CHANGE ‘HYSTERIA’",Fake

Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about Hillary’s run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.

“We met many times during the New York Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, and became very intimate. We shared many of the same values about sexual equality, fighting against the authoritarian, patriarchal, male-dominated society we were raised in” she explained.

"Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting “I Found A Smoking Gun” on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons’ involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clinton’s brother Tony Rodham.

A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.


Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the “fake news” propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a “Clinton Body Count.”  Monica Petersen’s name may well be added to it.


According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podesta’s email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children – not orphans – out of Haiti.  The two women’s history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.

The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epstein’s private child molestation island.

Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next-pagemessaging boards.

"Istanbul| Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon, not Neil Armstrong, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, yesterday, during an iftar (fast-breaking) dinner hosted by the Turkish Green Crescent.

Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque “in the crater” where they landed.

“It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969,” Erdogan said. “In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lagâri Hasan Çelebi, the “Ottoman Rocket Man”, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!”

The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya Çelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.

As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch “O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!”, before lighting the rocket’s gunpowder.  He then ascended more than 200 meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported: “O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!”.

This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi’s famous rocket flights, but it’s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635.
President Erdogan’s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.

“Why do you not believe it? Because you’ve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like you’ve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land,” Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II’s conquest of Istanbul in 1453. “This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottoman’s success during the Apollo 11 mission, but we’ll try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.”

The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.

ottoman
The description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesn’t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate.
The story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the “aviator” could have survived a flight into outer space.

His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode “Crash and Burn”.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya Çelebi’s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;

The team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been “extremely difficult” for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight","“OTTOMANS WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE MOON,” SAYS TURKISH PRESIDENT",Fake

"CULLMAN, Al. – An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fifty-nine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracy.

Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council – a fictional conservative action group – ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. “We were really pleased with the turnout,” said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORN’s northern Alabama office. “We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.”

Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. “We wanted to get an idea of the average voter’s understanding of the election process,” Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. “Under the category ‘U.S. President/U.S. Vice President,’ you had the option for Clinton/Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle,” Breyer explained. “Likewise, the option for Trump/Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle.”

Following the simulation’s conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two-thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “She won by a massive landslide,” recalled Breyer. “The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.”

“This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country,” said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. “This may have been a simulation but we’ve got multiple GOP leaders saying there’s going to be a rigged election next month. There’s a legitimate fear that you’ll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result, we’ll be forced to suffer another four years under Obama’s failed policies.”

In recent days, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him. “Of course there is a large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,” the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday.

"President-elect Donald J. Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion – which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol – as “extraordinary,” saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.

“We had a wonderful conversation,” the former reality TV star said of Kim. “He’s very different from the way he’s portrayed by the media and, you know, that’s something I can relate to.” Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. “We both love meatloaf,” Trump exclaimed. “He said he eats it all the time. I said ‘You ought to come to New York, I’ll give you the best meatloaf you’ve ever had in your life.”

Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. “If they had that nuclear threat, I’m sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula,” the president-elect said.

For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Korea’s single-party political system. “I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country.” During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. “I think it would be very good thing to have,” said Trump, adding, “You’d see a change in this country like you wouldn’t believe.”

Vice president-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trump’s transition team, described the ninety-minute Skype session as “very casual,” telling The New York Times that it’s not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. “This was the elected leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – a democracy very similar to ours – offering his congratulations and good wishes,” the vice president-elect explained.

"(NaturalNews) If a thug points a gun to your head, hands you a piece of paper, and says, “Sign this contract,” is the contract legally binding?

Of course it isn’t. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding.

Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they don’t change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo (“psyop” means psychological operations) which falsely claims the Russians “hacked” the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative.

The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians.

“Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters — and even death threats — in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday,” reports the NY Post today.

The NY Post also reports:

Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan.

For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side.

He said he’s been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook.

“Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth,” Banerian, 22, told The Post on Wednesday.

Leftists are “kidnapping” electoral voters and holding them for ransom

What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be “reclaimed” by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states.

In essence, the political left — organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton — has “psychologically kidnapped” the electoral voters, and they’re demanding a kind of “ransom” or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump.

In other words, this is a “political mugging” where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, “Your vote or your life.”

And if they manage to switch 37 electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a “victory” for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being “heroes” for saving the country.

Unbelievable, isn’t it? This is right out of the Kim Jong-Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, you’re heralded as a national hero. If you don’t do what they want, you get a bullet in the head.

This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place: Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out.

Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy… they’re pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose

What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they don’t get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. (Sound familiar? Look up the history of China’s “Cultural Revolution.”)

That’s the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And it’s perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left: If they don’t get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them.

I’ve got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness: We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes.

Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished.

Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use!

In observing all this, I’ve come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war won’t last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement.

It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all: That’s where we can put all the left-wing terrorists and traitors who tried (but failed) to overthrow the country. There, we’ll pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left-wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge.

Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they don’t agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

Remember: The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. That’s why they are so traumatized by reality: They’ve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left-wing media for as long as they can remember!

It’s time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left.

"A military airplane and two huge helicopters doing loops over Midtown last week were conducting an “emergency relocation” planning mission in case they needed to extract President-elect Donald Trump during an emergency or attack, DNAinfo New York has learned.

The sight of the C-130 search-and-rescue aircraft and two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters making passes over the heart of “no-fly” Manhattan for 40 minutes Tuesday, without warning or explanation, unnerved countless New Yorkers and tourists, many of whom took to Twitter and Facebook expressing post-9/11 concerns.

Sources told “On the Inside” that the flyovers were part of an “emergency relocation drill” designed to identify locations, primarily in Central Park, where a chopper could touch down near Trump’s home inside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, and safely evacuate Trump and others from the city. – READ MORE",Mysterious Manhattan Military Flyover Was Trump Rescue Exercise,Fake
"The founder of mythbusting website Snopes, which was recently tapped by Facebook as one of four “fact-check” organizations patrolling the site for “fake news,” embezzled $98,000 in company funds before spending it on “himself and the prostitutes he hired,” according to legal documents filed by his ex-wife reviewed by the Daily Mail.

After divorcing from his first wife, Barbara Mikkelson, David Mikkelson married Elyssa Young, a former porn star and current escort who now works for Snopes as an administrator, according to the Daily Mail.

The Daily Mail also revealed that top Snopes “fact-checker” Kim LaCapria claimed on her personal blog that she has “posted to Snopes” after smoking marijuana. As TheDC previously revealed, LaCapria describes herself as “openly left-leaning” and once claimed that Republicans fear “female agency.” (RELATED: Fact-Checking Snopes: Website’s Political ‘Fact-Checker’ Is Just A Failed Liberal Blogger)

As originally reported by TheDC, Snopes almost exclusively employs leftists as fact-checkers, many of whom have exhibited a clear distaste for Republican voters. TheDC could not identify a single Snopes fact-checker who comes from a conservative background. (RELATED: Snopes, Which Will Be Fact-Checking For Facebook, Employs Leftists Almost Exclusively)

"Hillary Clinton intends to keep her campaign organization together for the next four years and run again for president in 2020.

“She’s convinced that, sooner than later, the voters will come to their senses and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting [Donald] Trump in the White House,” a source close to Hillary told Ed Klein Confidential. “She’s sure the voters will beg her to get in the race and she says, ‘I’m going to run again in 2020.’”

Not all her advisers agree. In fact, several of them believe Hillary is in a bad way—deeply depressed, drinking too much, and delusional about her chances of making a successful run for the White House four years from now when she’ll be 73 and in shaky health.

But these advisers are afraid to dash Hillary’s presidential dreams and send her into an even deeper depression.

“Hillary is in a state of denial and accepts zero responsibility for her loss to Trump,” one of these sources said. “She’s convinced that [FBI Director James] Comey’s last-minute announcement that he was reopening his investigation of Hillary’s emails was planned in advance by her Republican enemies. She’s also convinced that [Russian president Vladimir] Putin was working with Trump and that the two were in direct contact.

“She further believes that a groundswell of anger is going to make it impossible for Trump to govern effectively,” the source continued. “In her view, Trump is a rank amateur in the art of politics, and he’s going to screw up badly and find himself in deep trouble.

“She told me—and I’m paraphrasing: ‘Trump has no idea what it’s like to run the biggest corporation in the world, the United States government. He has no f—–g idea how complicated it is, how many cogs are spinning at the same time, how many people are fighting at cross purposes, how much disinformation you get.’”

Expect the Congressional Republicans to grill Hillary Clinton, her aides, and the FBI for more information on the contents of the emails.

Fox News reports:

A federal court on Tuesday released the search warrant documents filed by the FBI to access a laptop used by disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election.

The FBI’s investigation found “27 email chains containing classified information” on a laptop that “was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information,” according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted.

The October re-opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton.

"Trump might be able to reverse it, but it’s tricky.

He’s only got a few weeks left to damage America’s energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in 1953 to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law?

Obama will use a section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans.

It’s unclear, however, how large Obama’s protected areas will be.

The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so-called 12(a) protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama.

Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from 2017 to 2022 that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic.

But that plan’s time period is limited, and President-elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes.

Previous presidents have used the 1953 law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species.

It’s unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessor’s actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo Obama’s actions.

This is a classic act of recklessness on Obama’s part – applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they can’t explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because he’s Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can.

Can he?

Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obama’s heading-out-the-door finger in the eye to America’s oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying Obama’s actions. He could also amend Obama’s drilling lease plan for the period of 2017-2022 by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them.

What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obama’s action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. It’s not clear how much force of law Obama’s action has, although it’s not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute – albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute.

I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obama’s actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trump’s action.

There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for Trump’s new EPA.

In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left-wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with.

As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama can’t come soon enough either.","Heading out the door, Obama bans offshore drilling in Atlantic, Arctic Oceans",Fake
"A woman who knows first-hand the brutality of ISIS testified before Congress not too long ago, and she had some pretty damning words for outgoing President Obama.

“The USA must act. We must terminate DAESH [Islamic State] and all such terror,” former ISIS sex slave Nadia Murad said through a translator.


Murad, who escaped captivity in 2014, also spoke out on the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando that killed 49 Americans. She said she wasn’t surprised.

“I knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere.”

And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a person’s insides, her self-fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one.

Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it:

“If a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are?” Murad said bravely.

Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee-deep in the bull pen called political correctness. Obama’s decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original 9-1-1 transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June.

And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the 2013 FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that 12 people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? Where’s the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? Don’t we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago?

I’ll bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle “racist” and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.

"Twenty millennial snowflakes want us to believe they got beat down by FOUR Trump supporters. And these alleged victims have ZERO evidence to support their claims.

Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately 20 of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street “chanting” and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The Trump supporters “confronted us and assaulted us yelling, ‘Blue Lives Matter’ ‘Get out of my country,’ calling us ‘faggots’ and ‘commies as they wailed on us,” Soeller tweeted. So, there were 20 millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating?

Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phones—doing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think 20 college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone.

Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the “Decolonize This Place” party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured.

“No more pettiness, time to organize,” Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for “queer anti-Trump activists.”

The anti-police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the 20 millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were “off-duty cops.”

Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The “build” of the attackers and the “way they took us down,” convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers.

Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on – at least that is what the snowflakes claim.

One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents.

The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale.

We’ll just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. I’m sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop-hating agitator and his 20 friends, who couldn’t take on four or five “cop built” guys.

"Lou Dobbs focuses on the prominent role the month of March has played in the Clinton email and other scandals. He calls it “The troublesome ides of March, especially March of last year. For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a ‘private’ server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.”

He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.”

In an interview Obama was asked, “Mr. ‘president,’ when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State?” Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, “The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”

Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that “Everybody else, however, didn’t believe the ‘president’ when he said that. And Clinton’s top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, ‘We need to clean this up,’ noting the ‘president’ has emails from Hillary that do not say ‘State.gov.'”

Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.”

March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton “investigation.”

"The Berlin attack is opening people’s eyes to the situation at hand, and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS, but they’re not the only ones facing people’s wrath.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed 12 people—because of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun.

Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them.

But there’s one problem with these refugees—wherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows.

It’s not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people.

“These are Merkel’s dead,” said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of Merkel’s CDU party also said to Saarland radio: “We must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see.”

Merkel was attending the ironically named “International Day of Migrants” when the attack took place, and she stated she was “shocked and shaken” by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye.

The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld.

Merkel’s opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries.

This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countries—violence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants.

They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. It’s like being in a destructive relationship—they’re already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut-sling, you don’t have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them.

And I’m sure that the German people don’t want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet.

"Donald Trump is responding to Bill Clinton’s statement in a very presidential way, giving the American people the truth as opposed to the Democrats’ lies.

Bill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get “angry, white men” to vote for him, and Trump responded by saying that Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused too much on the wrong states, as per Fox News.

Hillary’s husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it.

The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and that’s why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasn’t her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival.

Regarding Bill’s statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign.

It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see.

Hillary’s campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice.

She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as “beneath her” and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didn’t even bother trying to sell herself in enough states.

The Clintons lost because of her and her campaign’s mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillary’s email scandal 11 days before the election, which did hurt her numbers.

But frankly, if you’re going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you won’t be in the situation in the first place. It’s as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims.

Donald Trump’s response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesn’t wait for the mainstream media to twist his words—he delivers them himself.

It could also be that there isn’t much merit to such claims of abuse.

They’re all aware of how wealthy the man is, and could’ve come forward years (or in some cases, decades) ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true.

"The 2016 GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest. While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man who’s been called upon to lead our nation.

“Let’s not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. Let’s follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington,” Paul wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.

“We have tried it before,” Paul wrote. “In fact, the most successful Republican presidents (and a few Democrats) led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less.” 

Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.

When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our 35th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in 1958 that rivaled the one of 2008. He set out to determine how to get the country back on track.

As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in Kennedy’s first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant 2.7 percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of 30 percent. 

Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in 1964, and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually.

One of Kennedy’s other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a 97-3 vote in 1986. The nation enjoyed a long-term growth rate of roughly four percent per year.

In 2016, the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents’ terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time.

In standing with Donald Trump’s ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves.

If Trump doesn’t follow through and it is just a “read my lips” moment, he will probably be a one-term president. He has Paul’s support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, “Great Again.”","BREAKING – Rand Paul Stands Up For TRUMP, Says What All Of Us Were Thinking",Fake
"U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) worked in Afghanistan from July 2008 through June 2015 under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting 30 Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly $260 million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program.

The logic seems sounds, in a country at war; we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks.

On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, “The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations.” This must be code for, “We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them,” because this is exactly what the group has done.

Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, “One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than 430 miles away from the listed coordinates, while another 11 facilities were more than six miles away.”

The letter elaborated, “SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at 30 of 79 facilities in Badakhshan” – an Afghan province – but “was unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these 29 health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water.”


The money to help is going somewhere else…

Sopko went on to say that only 12 of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about 15% of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be.

In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, “coordinates for 22 of the 79 facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan; Afghanistan’s neighboring country to the southeast.”

One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, “four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location.”

It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. “As SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided,” Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith.

A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, “The agency no longer maintains location data and “obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make.”

Sopko countered this statement, ““USAID’s position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. [W]e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities.”

It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, “Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services.”

Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another $228 million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue.

USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID “does not intend to maintain coordinates.” They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities.

Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though.

The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. “[W]e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows,” which “indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety.”  Inspectors also found “exposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff.”


Horrible conditions

This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit.

Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out.

Why is nobody in Washington asking questions?

The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan.

As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of “health clinics” was believable at the time.

No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American.

"Trump said that Obama had a hand in creating ISIS. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, Vladimir Putin, of all people, has confirmed this.

Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it.



Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. Putin’s strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources.

A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing 17,000 of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review.

Something tells me this isn’t the type of “experience” that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of Putin’s statement.

In Clinton’s attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of.

Let’s get something absolutely clear: in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our country’s wonderful principles would soon see them slip away.

The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same. We, and the rest of the world, could not afford to have the ISIS rebels grow stronger and more organized. In the midst of all this, Donald Trump began to throw out massive truth bombs, including that Obama and Clinton created ISIS by virtue of their policies. This seemed incredibly outrageous to liberals.

However, credit Trump for being bold enough to say it. This is definitely the type of leadership we need. There is no question it is a sad day in America when it is Vladimir Putin who sounds more like an American than even our own sitting president. Thankfully, we’ll soon have a true leader in the White House.

"President Obama headed to a golf course moments after receiving reports that a truck had plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin in a potential terrorist attack, according to White House pool reports.

Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii for the holidays, was also briefed by his national security team on the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey just before departing for the Mid-Pacific Country Club.

White House press liaison Eric Schultz wrote in a memo that Obama left his rental vacation home at 10:21 a.m. HST, or 3:21 p.m. EST, after a press van held at the house for 11 minutes awaiting the president.

“Spectators on the street threw shakas and recorded photos or video on cell phones as the motorcade made the 10-minute drive to Mid-Pacific Country Club, where the president will be golfing under cloudy skies,” Schultz wrote, according to Mediate.

Nine people were killed and at least 50 others were injured in the Berlin truck attack. Police believe the incident was deliberate.

Russia, meanwhile, declared the killing of Ambassador Andrey Karlov in Ankara an “act of terrorism.”

The president has faced scrutiny for his decisions to golf during crises.

In August, the former FEMA Director Michael Brown, who oversaw the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, condemned Obama for continuing to golf during his two-week vacation on Martha’s Vineyard while historic floods were devastating parts of Louisiana.","Moments After Being Briefed on Berlin Attack, Obama Hops on Golf Cart…",Fake
"The Democrats thought they had the election “in the bag”. CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NYT, Huffington Post, and a whole host of other news stations were calling a big Trump loss from day one.

They had to eat their words when the American People showed up on November 8th to prove them dead wrong.

But What Happened Hillary?
We are all familiar with the countless leaks that performed catastrophic damage against the Democratic Party. But, in reality, all it did was show the lies, deceit, and corruption already taking place. Nothing that we saw is new, and it should be a bold wake-up call to anyone who believes what our government tells us without thought or question.

When the dust settled, however, it was clear that the Democratic Party created a wave they never saw coming; they never expected the American People to rise up by the thousands to declare their disgust for the Washington status quo.

How did they create this wave? Their initial strategy elevated Trump. They intended to use Trump as a “Pied Piper” candidate they would use to portray the Republican Party in a bad light. Their failed strategy was revealed in WikiLeak 1120.

"President Barack Obama’s legacy might soon be tarnished beyond repair. The long-awaited results from an in-depth investigation into Obama’s past have just been revealed.

Barack Obama’s birth certificate is a fake… a complete forgery, and now evidence to prove it is headed to Congress. Arizona Sheriff Joe Apraio’s investigation into Obama’s birth certificate found multiple “inconsistencies,” which could allow Congress to impeach the 44th president of the United States even after he leaves office, WND reports.

The forensic investigation into Obama’s birth certificate reportedly proves the “birthers” were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place.

Corsi’s book, Where’s The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the public’s attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a “natural-born citizen” but does not really define exactly what the entails – meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

“I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,” Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather.

Sheriff Joe Apraio’s forensic investigation into Obama’s birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna Ah’nee.

The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna Ah’nee birth certificate, include the word “Honolulu,” the word “Oahu” twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators.

The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April 25th stamp might have been lifted from another document.

One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court-qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner.

Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation.

“We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack Obama’s long form birth certificate it not authentic,” the report said.

Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes: “The (nail in the coffin) that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both [certificates].” Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint.","Just Days Before Leaving Office, Obama Gets News that Could INVALIDATE His Entire Presidency",Fake

"A writer for the NY Daily News argued Tuesday that “justice was served” following the assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov.
According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, “Allahu akbar,” and, “Don’t forget Aleppo,” was not terrorism, but instead a noble act.
“As Vladimir Putin’s man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictator’s war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home,” Kuntzman claims. “Andrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al-Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers.”
Kuntzman, who was “surprised his murder didn’t come months ago,” attempted to draw comparisons to the 1938 assassination of Ernst vom Rath, the Nazi ambassador to France.
“Like Karlov, Rath was the public face of atrocity — in this case, Adolf Hitler’s genocide, anti-Semitism and coming global aggression,” Kuntzman wrote, comparing Russia’s role in Syria to Hitler’s across multiple continents.
After receiving backlash for the controversial piece, Kuntzman further defended his position on social media, arguing that Karlov was a soldier – therefore shooting him in the back outside of a warzone was an appropriate move.","ASSASSINATION OF RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED, LIBERAL JOURNALIST SAYS",Fake

"Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. He’s since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.

There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obama’s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.

673-bansal-obama-discrimination

As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. That’s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ “Civil Rights” Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just “who we are” under this racist America-hating Islamist.

One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasn’t enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.

She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?

Subject: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates

 

Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American

candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside

boards/agencies/policy committees. A couple things to note about the list

of Muslim American candidates:

 

1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab

American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many

Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of

outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim

American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of

uncertain religion (esp. Christian).

 

2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a

Secretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,

there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outside

boards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The

very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly

involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,

had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I

thought we should seek new talent. But there’s no magic to some of the

placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the

people may be moved to other categories.

 

3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount

of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be

ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would

not survive such a vet — but I do personally know, at least in part,

virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very

few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).

 

4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end

of the second category, but for various reasons, I didn’t think any of

them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.

Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate

them further.","WikiLeaks – Obama Racist Recruiting – No White, Christian Americans Need Apply",Fake
"CARSON CITY, Nv. – A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty-five deaths.

Just hours before the start of Nevada’s Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty-five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. “Evacuation orders have been issued for your state,” the call calmly explained. “You are to immediately report to your precinct’s designated polling center for further instructions.”

The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoon’s robocall -perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation- didn’t stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senator’s campaign manager, was meant to “merely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency.”

In an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind-the-scenes alliance in order to conduct a “dishonest and misleading smear campaign” against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two-dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him “at the expense of the good people of Nevada.”

Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of “denying people their constitutional rights;” Donald Trump complained that Cruz’s “deceptive tactics” had likely cost him “millions” of votes.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. – According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President Obama’s bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.

By the GAO’s estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. “The question on everyone’s mind when they look at a report like this is, ‘What exactly is he doing in there?'” Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day “on a good day.”

Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. “I think it’s very telling,” Senator McCain said.

“The average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days,” said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. “Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight,” Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, “With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.”

However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. “In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict,” Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now.

Despite President Obama’s low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if he’s a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the men’s room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.

“This is simply unacceptable,” Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. “This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with.” Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers “a buck or two,” often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. “It’s uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, it’s the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents.”",Special Report: Obama’s Bathroom Breaks Cost Taxpayers $4.1 Billion in 2015,Fake
"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic State’s leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week.

According to the report, more than half of the GOP’s leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States.

To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidate’s campaign.

“It’s really an ingenious system,” said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. “Obviously the senator doesn’t see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues,” Arevalo told CNN, continuing, “That said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to women’s rights and gun control.” Arevalo added that candidates have a “moral obligation” to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike.

In the wake of the nation’s most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty-two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States.

Currently there are an estimated 700,000 people on the U.S. government’s terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe “upon the rights of law-abiding citizens.”",ISIS Leadership Among Top GOP Campaign Contributors,Fake
"NEW YORK, Ny. – During a Democratic fundraiser in New York last Monday, President Barack Obama announced he has signed a contract with CNN to co-moderate the fifth GOP debate with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Set for December 15th in Las Vegas, Nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy.

“They need a little touch of reality,” the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. “This isn’t an audition for the babysitter’s club, it’s the Oval Office.” In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the “intellectual and moral fortitude” required to run the country.


“Presidential debates shouldn’t be centered around catering to the candidates’ comfort level,” said CNN political analyst Melissa Cunningham, referring to the most recent CNBC debate which prompted a failed attempt by the GOP to harness control of future debates. Cunningham continued, “It’ll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job they’re vying for.”

Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for “once again trying to sandbag the Republican party” and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer.

Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who many speculate will play “good cop” to President Obama’s “bad cop” during the debate, visited the White House this week to brainstorm possible debate questions with the president. “I’m told the meeting was very constructive,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

Fox News will host the fourth installment of the Republican presidential debates on November 10th in Milwaukee. Subsequently, the fifth GOP debate, featuring President Obama and Jon Stewart, is scheduled to air December 15th at 6 p.m. PST on CNN.

"“Dear white people…niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go”

UPDATE: Poe deleted his tweet and then claimed that he never made the comments. The tweet is archived here and a screenshot of it appears below.

He’s now whining about “slander”. Talk crap, then play the victim when you get challenged on your crap. Same process EVERY time with social justice warriors.

Prominent ‘Black Lives Matter’ activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for “white people”: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, “niggas” will ‘incite riots everywhere’.

“Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know,” Poe tweeted today.

He followed up with another promise: “Trump wins aint no more rules fammo. We’ve been too nice as is.”

Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of ‘Black Lives Matter’ and was credited with coining the phrase, “This ain’t your grandparents’ civil rights movement.”

The rapper was one of the co-founders of Hands Up United, a “social justice” organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area.

St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers.

The “hands up, don’t shoot!” mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.

Poe’s threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trump’s rally in Chicago last week are planning a “mass civil disobedience movement” beginning next month.

Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest.

“I think you would have riots. I think you would have riots,” Trump told CNN’s Chris Cuomo this morning. “I think you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do.”

Trump was quickly blasted by many sectors of the media for invoking the prospect of riots, a sentiment that wasn’t seen immediately after the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, when publications like Time Magazine argued that rioting was a justifiable form of protest.",Top Black Lives Matter Activist: ‘We Will Incite Riots Everywhere if Trump Wins’,Fake
"The Obama administration refuses to even utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’, so it’s no surprise that they have refused to call the murders of Christians by ISIS ‘genocide’, but that’s exactly what it is. ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they do.

When the House votes 383-0 against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House.

From Fox News:

The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East — putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week.

The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of 383-0.

The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS’ atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.

“When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injustice—it is a threat to civilization itself,” Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. “We must call the violence by its proper name: genocide.”

The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March 17 deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administration’s hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position.

There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on.

Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obama’s notions.

If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama.",BOOM! The House Just Voted 383-0 In Support of Christians… Obama Isn’t Happy About This,Fake

You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.

This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T – Daily Mail)

Newt Gingrich brilliantly stated,

“THIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. A TEAM CAN HAVE MORE YARDS AND LOSE THE GAME. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MANY POINTS YOU PUT ON THE BOARD.”

"This is really one of those funny, beautiful moments in history when a big, old, and unreliable news source like the Washington Post gets caught red handed in their own web of lies.

You see, just last week the Washington Post published an article in which they claimed to have an actual list of news companies that work for Vladimir Putin. Well, surprise, surprise, that all turned out to be a big old load of CRAP!

Today the Post was forced to add new “notes” to that article which essentially read that their list was crap and the source they claimed was reliable is actually just a bunch of Liberal morons.

Their “source” was an anonymous website called PropOrNot which said they had a obtained a list of people directly employed by Russia or “idiots” that repeat Russian Propaganda.

The beautiful irony is that the only website dumb enough to actually believe their list was the Washington Post. Do you know why? Because they are nothing but scam artists.

Let me break this down plain and simple for you folks. WaPo and other old news sources lost all of their Trust when they lied about the election this year. Of course, the problem goes even further back to when they LIED about Nukes being in Iraq.

"Hillary Clinton has reached the 2,383 delegates today. This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.

*** This is an outright lie.

Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.

“It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,” he said.

*** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?



Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.

“Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination,” he said. “She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.

“Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.”

The Clinton campaign tweeted the following:

In another recent tweet, Clinton said that “we are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.”

We can agree with that statement. We are on a historic moment and Hillary Clinton is about to get SHREDDED by Donald Trump in the worst presidential sweeps in history. (h/t The Blaze)",BREAKING: Hillary Clinton’s Nomination is a LIE and WE HAVE PROOF!!!!,Fake

But that’s not all. Unlike normal politicians, Donald Trump is not coming into the meeting absolutely NEEDING their cash. In fact, he has more than enough of his own to whoop Hillary Clinton back to 1967! This gives him what professional negotiators call a “Power Position.”

"Newt Gingrich has been waging an INSANE jihad against Donald Trump over the Mexican Judge comments made earlier in the week. Many people are going to be disappointed by this, but Newt flipped sides because of the money.

The mainstream media reported earlier last month that Sheldon Adelson was willing to contribute $100 million to Trump’s campaign. It was not reported much, but there was another $100 million that was offered to Trump if he picked Newt Gingrich. That’s why Gingrich was so nice to Trump.



When Trump the entire offer.declined the entire offer. Gingrich started lashing out at him publicly. He even recently claimed that the comments Trump made about the judge were “one of his worst mistakes.” All Trump did was point out publicly that the Trump University lawyer has ties to the La Raza Hispanic nationalist organization.

“I DON’T KNOW WHAT TRUMP’S REASONING WAS, AND I DON’T CARE,” GINGRICH TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST.

What a traitor. It’s hard to see it happen because a lot of people were hoping that Newt would be the VP. It is now showing that he is just bitter for having Trump change his mind.

It’s in Trump’s best interest to pick someone that identifies with him ideologically as his VP. This makes a lot of sense because Gingrich has done an almost complete 180 since last week. But, we shouldn’t be too torn up about it – remember that Newt Gingrich wanted a moon base at one point.

“TO THOSE WHO VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE, IN EITHER PARTY, I WILL WORK HARD TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT, AND I WILL WORK VERY HARD TO EARN THAT SUPPORT,” TRUMP DECLARED.

“TO ALL OF THOSE BERNIE SANDERS VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD BY A RIGGED SYSTEM OF SUPERDELEGATES, WE WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS,” HE PROCLAIMED

Trump then mentioned all the terrible deals that Sanders has been shouting about since he announced his campaign. He said that he would get rid of those deals in order to protect American workers. This is how Trump will save America. He will not sell us out.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.



During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values.”

“The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,” Obama said. “Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah’s Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this ‘one nation under God’, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying ‘liberty and justice for all’, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.”

Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of “under God” runs afoul of the First Amendment’s establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America’s values.

“I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyone’s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.”

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledge’s language and suggested that the pledge’s mention of God sends the wrong message to America’s children.

“I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.”

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president’s order, referring to the president as an “illegitimate Muslim traitor.”



“As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.

“This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.”

Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama’s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.

“When our children are forced to chant, ‘One nation under God‘, whose God are they referring to exactly?” Ketchum said, “From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child’s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.” Ketchum continued, “This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.”

While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.

“Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a president’s executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.”



Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.

“It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.” Mikkleson continues, “A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’, ‘recycled’, ‘hoax’, saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.” Mikkelson further explains, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, it’s so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. But we don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?”

Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words “under God” were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.”

"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.



The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is “violent” and “hostile to African Americans.”

“If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, it’s that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?”

Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.

“The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end,” Obama said. “We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.”

It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”

In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthem’s militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.



Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.

“The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds,” Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. “I can tell you that when I’m elected I’ll have them both thrown in jail, and I’ll make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.”

Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the President’s order is reversed.

“The national anthem is part of the game,” Horner told ESPN. “He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they aren’t going to sing the anthem, I’m not going to play ball. I think you’re going to find that I’m not the only one who feels this way. I’ve already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.”

The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this “A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom.” He said that “encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea”, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like “a pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.”

Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.

“People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives.” the commissioner’s office told CNN via e-mail. “There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the President’s leadership on this difficult issue.”



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.

“This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country,” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President

“What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”

While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the president’s decision.

"Charleston, SC — Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.

“Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what?” Murray said to the roaring crowd.

Murray’s speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.

“I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach,” Murray told the crowd. “Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and they’re acting like 4-year-olds. They’re up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.”

Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.



“I don’t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he’s just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. He’s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what he’s doing.”

“I pretty much don’t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now,” Murray told the crowd, “I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em’, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion.” Murray continued, “I’m always traveling around the world, but I’m proud to call America, the good ole’ U.S. of A, my home. I think there’s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-be’s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz’s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it’s sad that people go along with it, and can’t see it for what it really is.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.

“We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought,” Bradley said. “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”

Murray finished the rally by saying, “I’m no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as it’s with me. Look, we don’t need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!”

Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, it’s actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our “writers” will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the article’s headline that we’re debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and that’s it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! I’ll tell what, if it wasn’t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.” Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, “Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.”

Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.

According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a “Fort Hood style” attack.

Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, “traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring” according to law enforcement officials.

Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage “lone wolf” style attacks on Washington DC.

The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.
