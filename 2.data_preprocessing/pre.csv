PHOENIX AZ AP — For months now rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event“I was given  to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills” said  Paul Horner “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event I interviewed with them and got the part”Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign but Horner disagrees“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign” Horner said “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’ After I was hired they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is” Horner continued “It was mostly women in their ’s at the interview that I went to Plus all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton”Craigslist ad for Donald Trump protestersA screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to The actual ad has since been removed Dennis System File  ABC News“I knew those weren’t real protesters they were too organized and smart” said  Tom Downey a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff” Downey continued “I think we did a good job though I was shouting at them the whole time calling them losers telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house I got a bunch of highfives from my fellow Trump supporters It was a great time”When asked about the other protesters at the rally Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class At the rally talking with some of them I learned they only paid Latinos  Muslims  and African Americans  I don’t think they were looking for any Asians Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received  across the board I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid“I’ll protest that guy for free” Bradley said “Trump is creating a place for likeminded ignorant bigoted hatefilled individuals to gather and unite You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that” Bradley continued “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless they only care about themselves and their white race I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter I think it would make me change my opinion about them”Horner said the group had a mandatory sixhour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’ things like that We were told how to respond to antiTrump comments too If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be the Latinos in our group would say ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘Fck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’”David Mikkelson founder of Snopescom a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral and we spend a minute or two debunking it we make lots of money Stories like this have helped put my children through college buy a new car a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child” Mikkleson said “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘ but that’s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that’s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons For example do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its taxexempt status Did you actually read our story Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax What is the actual website URL We claim to know it but no real information is posted by us” Mikkelson continues “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar oh the hypocrisy but it is so funny at the same time We also like to post fake unfunny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is  fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money” Mikkelson laughs “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are  proven false but since we block archiveorg it just becomes their word versus ours Plus I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts it results in more visitors Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademarkprotected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘ The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It’s just more of our hack unethical journalism and I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click our ads regardless bottom line so why do the extra work To be honest I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real actual work”ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign

Khizr Khan the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J Trump has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia—and to international Islamist investors through his own law firm In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States—and has deep ties to the “Clinton Cash” narrative through the Clinton FoundationKhan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s behalf Donald Trump—the Republican nominee for president Their son US Army Captain Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in  Khizr Khan in his speech to the DNC lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terroristsSince then Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos—who served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clinton’s White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC network—pushed Trump on the matter in an interview Trump’s comments in that interview have sparked the same minirebellion inside his party in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before The usual suspects inside the GOP from former Florida Gov Jeb Bush to Sen Lindsey Graham RSC to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov John Kasich have condemned Trump in one way or another The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats as well their friends throughout media are driving the train as fast as they canBut until now it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked It turns out however in addition to being Gold Star parents the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migration–and to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselvesKhan according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells LLP a major DC law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years Citing federal government disclosure forms the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago“Hogan Lovells LLP another US firm hired by the Saudis is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through  disclosures show” Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reportedThe federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of  which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal governmentThe government of Saudi Arabia of course has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between  and  million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between  and  million” Schoffstall wroteTrump of course has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money“Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays” Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June according to Politico “Hillary must return all money from such countries”“Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate” Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time “I am calling on her to immediately return the  million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation”Of course to this day Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian governmentSchoffstall’s piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle per Federal Election Commission FEC records has bundled more than  in donations for Clinton’s campaign this yearKhan’s connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep according to a report from Lawcom written by Katelyn Polantz“Many lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in  when US Army Capt Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber” Polantz wrote “ThenHogan  Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldier’s father Khizr Khan a Muslim American immigrant was among their beloved colleagues”Polantz wrote that Khan worked at the megaDC law firm for years“Khan spent seven years from  to  in the Washington DC office of thenHogan  Hartson” Polantz wrote “He served as the firm’s manager of litigation technology Although he did not practice law while at Hogan Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system On Thursday night he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer”But representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle  for Clinton’s campaign are hardly the only places where the Khanconnected Hogan Lovells DC megafirm brush elbows with Clinton Cash The firm also handles Hillary Clinton’s taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton set up a homebrew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was “extremely careless” according to FBI director James Comey“A lawyer at Hogan  Hartson  has been Bill and Hillary Clinton’s goto guy for tax advice since  according to documents released Friday by Hillary Clinton’s campaign” The American Lawyer’s Nate Raymond wrote in  as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year “The Clintons’ tax returns for  show combined earnings of  million on which they paid  million in taxes New Yorkbased tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice and also regularly advises corporations on MA and executive compensation”Breitbart News’ Patrick Howley in a deep investigative piece on Hillary Clinton’s email scandal late last year uncovered how Topaz’s firm—which employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary Clinton’s taxes—is also connected to the email scandal“Topaz was a partner at Hogan  Hartson which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells where Topaz continues to practice The firm’s lawyers were major donors to Hillary Clinton’s first presidential campaign” Howley wroteFor her private email system Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic“Hogan  Hartson handled the patent for MX Logic’s emailfiltering program which McAfee bought the small company for  million in  in order to acquire” Howley wrote “The MX Logic company’s application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in  on Hogan  Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan  Hartson attorney Hogan  Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports The email company’s Clinton links present more evidence that Clinton’s political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use”If that all isn’t enough that same Hogan  Hartson law firm—now Hogan Lovells—employed Loretta Lynch the current Attorney General of the United States Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton Hillary’s husband and the former president on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server systemKhan’s own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States One of his specific areas of practice according to the website is “ Treaty Investors  Investments  Related Immigration Services”Sen Chuck Grassley the chairman of the US Senate’s Judiciary Committee has detailed how the  immigration program is “riddled with flaws and corruption”“Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hill—on this island surrounded by reality—that we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts” Grassley said in a statement earlier this year “The Government Accountability Office the media industry experts members of congress and federal agency officials have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities Allow me to mention a few of the flaws”From there Sen Grassley listed out several of the “flaws” with the  immigration program that Khan works in– Investments can be spent before business plans are approved – Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments  – Jobs created are not “direct” or verifiable jobs but rather are “indirect” and based on estimates and economic modeling– Jobs created by US investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card even if  money is only a fraction of the total invested– Investment funds are not adequately vetted – Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals– The investment level has been stagnant for nearly  years– There’s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects– Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval– Regional centers don’t have to certify that they comply with securities laws  – There’s no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers– There’s no set of sanctions for violations no recourse for bad actors– There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center– Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas– Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency– Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes especially for those politically connected – Visas are not properly scrutinized – Visas are pushed through despite security warnings– Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance– The agency does not do site visits for each and every project– There’s no transparency on how funds are spent who is paid and what investors are told about the projects they invest inThat’s not to mention the fact that according to Sen Grassley there have been serious national security violations in connection with the  program that Khan works in and around already In fact the program—according to Grassley—was used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States“There are also classified reports that detail the national security fraud and abuse Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story” Grassley said in the early February  statement “The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability including the export of sensitive technology economic espionage use by foreign government agents and terrorists investment fraud illicit finance and money laundering”Maybe all of this is why–as Breitbart News has previously noted–the Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative Hillary Clinton’s coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography ,Trump University Offers Sarah

CLEVELAND — Avik Roy is a Republican’s Republican A health care wonk and editor at Forbes he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls — Mitt Romney Rick Perry and Marco Rubio Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative idealsBut when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention he said something I’ve never heard from an establishment conservative before The Grand Old Party is going to die“I don’t think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way” he said “There’s going to be a disruption”Roy isn’t happy about this He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans“Until the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle it will not have the moral authority to lead the country” he told meThis is a standard assessment among liberals but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker Our conversation had the air of a confessional of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong had failed had sinnedHis history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy It begins with a fatal error in  survived on the willful selfdelusion of people like Roy himself and ended with Donald Trump“I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken” Roy tells me “Trump is not a random act This election is not a random act”The conservative movement’s founding error Barry GoldwaterIn  William F Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review focusing on a free market social conservatism and a muscular foreign policy Buckley’s ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in  with the nomination of Barry Goldwater While Goldwater lost the  general election his ideas eventually won out in the GOP culminating in the Reagan Revolution of  Goldwater’s defeat is spun as a story of triumph how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP But according to Roy it’s the first act of a tragedy“Goldwater’s nomination in  was a historical disaster for the conservative movement” Roy tells me “because for the ensuing decades it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights”“THE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISM”Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of  He himself was not especially racist — he believed it was wrong on free market grounds for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate But this “principled” stance identified the GOP with the prosegregation camp in everyone’s eyes while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of antiracismThis had a double effect Roy says First it forced black voters out of the GOP Second it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress the postGoldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites“The fact is today the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of  — the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans” Roy says “Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem”Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP — hence Trump Avik Roy L discusses Obamacare on television William B PlowmanNBCNBC NewsGetty ImagesThe available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that  really was a pivotal political moment in exactly the way Roy describesYet Republican intellectuals have long denied this fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights In  National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was “popular but indefensible”This revisionism according to Roy points to a much bigger conservative delusion They cannot admit that their party’s voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals“Conservative intellectuals and conservative politicians have been in kind of a bubble” Roy says “We’ve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism — philosophical economic conservatism In reality the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism”Conservative intellectuals for the most part are horrified by racism When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality they really mean it Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented they need to believe that the party isn’t racistSo they deny the party’s racist history that its  success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats’ embrace of civil rights And they deny that to this day Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty“It’s the power of wishful thinking None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we’ve inherited” Roy saysHe expands on this idea “It’s a common observation on the left but it’s an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn’t true — which is that conservatism has become and has been for some time much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy I think today even now a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem”This Roy believes is where the conservative intellectual class went astray By refusing to admit the truth about their own party they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump’s rise They told themselves over and over again that Goldwater’s victory was a triumphBut in reality it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive Trump’s politics of aggrieved white nationalism — labeling black people criminals Latinos rapists and Muslims terrorists — succeeded because the party’s voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights“ tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement — but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn’t notice” Roy concludes glumlyFor conservatism to live the conservative movement has to die A sign with one of the RNC’s most popular slogans Bill ClarkCQ Roll CalOver beers I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally His answer is very sad“When Marco  lost I went through the five stages of grief It was tough I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life” he says“I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work I did it because I felt it was important and I care about the country Maybe it’s cheesy to say that but I really sincerely do” he continues “So then okay what do I do Do I do the same things I’ve been doing for the last four years To me just to do that to collect a paycheck didn’t make a lot of sense”This soulsearching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion The Republican Party and the conservative movement that propped it up is doomedBoth are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act but that just isn’t a winning formula in a nation that’s increasingly black and brown Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share“Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new rightofcenter party emerging in its place or a third party will emerge à la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the ” Roy saysThe work of conservative intellectuals today he argues is to devise a new conservatism — a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America“I think it’s incredibly important to take stock” he says “and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty”I don’t know how this would work I don’t think Roy knows eitherFor the entire history of modern conservatism its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism That’s Roy’s own diagnosis and I think it’s correct As a result we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacyI’ve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about nonracist conservative ideals Writers like Andrew Sullivan Ross Douthat Reihan Salam Michael Brendan Dougherty and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we haveBut not one of these writers smart as they are has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans whereas liberalism and social democracy are The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy’s “cranky old white people” — and they’re dying offMaybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem I hope they do America needs a viable intellectually serious rightofcenter partyBecause we now know what the alternative looks like It’s

’m cool with you removing me from your friends list if you don’t like this post You can even disown me if you like But Donald Trump isn’t a good person nor would he be a good president I can understand a difference in politics I can understand if you don’t like a government run by Democrats I can understand if you don’t like certain ideologies like Socialism But I can’t understand why you would support someone as hateful sexist racist and ignorant as Donald TrumpHow do you support him so blindly Ask yourself are you a racist sexist hateful and ignorant person as well I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth because he’s so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies Just because Trump is saying these things doesn’t suddenly make them right It’s not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals It’s not okay to marginalize an entire race of people saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our countryWhite people also have bad apples So does every race of people We’re all human Some humans are really bad people Some are really good And it doesn’t matter what color they are it makes no difference whatsoever Trump says he is just telling the truth But whose truth There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position like the President of the United StatesThe Japanese Internment camps were wrong Segregation was wrong Slavery was wrong We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred In WWII more than  million people died worldwide Why Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion The United States lost more than  lives fighting in that war against the same ideas that Trump is pushing The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character“They always say it’s so important to make your voice heard to get out and vote But I’m not sure if it’s ever been more important than now”We’re still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War WWI WWII Vietnam Iraq and the War on Terror And it isn’t just ISIS or AlQaeda It’s our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all They just went madThe kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters Supporters who think it’s okay to say things like “light the motherer on fire” while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time but no matter what he did there was no reason to set him on fire In fact there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire Unless it’s because they are dead and they wish to be crematedTrump’s supporters are angry and anger is infectious I can tell you as a nonsupporter of Trump I am just as angry We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together not tear us apart Why do we have to fight against helping each other against common sense against a united Nation The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it making it worse every day Trump is a bully a loud mouth ignorant sexist racist disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially beHe is the crazy person at your dinner table who won’t stop running his mouth The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home He’s the guy you have to endure until he leaves all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space Lucky for us this isn’t Grandma’s house so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote countThey always say it’s so important to make your voice heard to get out and vote But I’m not sure if it’s ever been more important than now Differences of political ideals are one thing I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics but racism isn’t one of them neither is hate neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability or their sexual preferenceBy supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were Back when gay people had to hide in fear back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched back when it was okay to openly hate Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen  Because electing Trump won’t make any of that come true We’re past that as a nation or at least I thought we were“I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics but racism isn’t one of them neither is hate neither is the belittling of women”If you’re not a racist bigoted misogynistic jerk then voting for Trump simply because you don’t like Democrats is wrong If you are one of his supporters and you’re just a racist and you don’t care who knows it then vote for him but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind I’m sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours worship different gods than you and have skin that isn’t whiteTo all the people of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against to all the women that don’t meet his standards of beauty to all the good Muslims and Christians Mormons and Catholics and Jewish Italians Irish and Asians to the AfricanAmericans and Native Americans to anyone who has ever been persecuted belittled made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing please I implore you to get out and vote against him Don’t let the progress of this great nation be halted We’ve come too farIn this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom for Truth and Justice We fight for what’s right And what Trump is doing and saying isn’t right Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln“I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in High Places will follow and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed”And he couldn’t be more right Trump IS the one percent he IS working on your prejudices and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected make no doubt about itIf you don’t

attack in Orlando Fla I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshipedBeing Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage In our culture when people think “Muslim” the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai Kareem AbdulJabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction It’s of a scary terrorist character from “Homeland” or some monster from the newsToday with the presidential candidate Donald J Trump and others like him spewing hate speech prejudice is reaching new levels It’s visceral and scary and it affects how people live work and pray It makes me afraid for my family It also makes no senseAziz Ansari’s parents Fatima and Shoukath Ansari Credit Photo courtesy Aziz AnsariThere are approximately  million Muslim Americans After the attack in Orlando The Times reported that the FBI is investigating  potential “homegrown violent extremists” a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State If everyone on that list is Muslim American that is  percent of the Muslim American population If you round that number it is  percent The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinicsI asked a young friend of mine a woman in her  of Muslim heritage how she had been feeling after the attack “I just feel really bad like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed” she said “I’m really sick of having to explain that I’m not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown”I myself am not a religious person but after these attacks anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone elseI understand that as far as these problems go I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor When someone on the street gives me a strange look it’s usually because they want to take a selfie with me not that they think I’m a terroristBut I remember how those encounters can feel A few months after the attacks of Sept  I remember walking home from class near NYU where I was a student I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled “Terrorist” To be fair I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed but I’m not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human historyThe vitriolic and hatefilled rhetoric coming from Mr Trump isn’t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window He has said that people in the American Muslim community “know who the bad ones are” implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks Not only is this wrongheaded but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks By Mr Trump’s logic after the huge financial crisis of  the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white malesAccording to reporting by Mother Jones since  there have been  mass shootings in this country and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males I doubt we’ll hear Mr Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities “who the bad ones are” or call for restricting white males’ freedomsOne way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear Keep militarygrade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people those with a history of violence and those on FBI watch lists But despite sitins and filibusters our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles but we’re still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport If we’re going to use the “they’ll just find another way” argument let’s use that to let us keep our shoes onXenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr Trump’s campaign long before the attack in Orlando This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans “rapists” who were “bringing drugs” to this country Numerous times he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept   This has been continually disproved but he stands by it I don’t know what every Muslim American was doing that day but I can tell you what my family was doing I was studying at NYU and I lived near the World Trade Center When the second plane hit I was on the phone with my mother who called to tell me to leave my dorm buildingThe haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head My building was close enough that it shook upon impact I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan My family unable to reach me on my cellphone was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse There was absolutely no cheering Only sadness horror and fearMr Trump in response to the attack in Orlando began a tweet with these words “Appreciate the congrats” It appears that day he was the one who was celebrating after an attack,Aziz Ansari Why Trump Makes Me Scared

on New Day on Monday Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald TrumpWasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation a Democratic source saidGoing forward the best way for me to accomplish those goals  is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention Wasserman Schultz said in the statementAs party chair this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats but for all Americans she saidSanders campaign manager We must elect ClintonSanders campaign manager We must elect Clinton  Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election She had been a CNN political commentator but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract effective immediately although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity CNN said CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her roleSeparately a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a

saying For the last eight years Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back This afternoon I called her to let her know that I am gratefulAnd Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the partyI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this years historic convention in Philadelphia and I know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership Clinton saidAfter slamming Wasserman Schultz as highly overrated Trump speaking at a rally in Roanoke Virginia knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soontobe former DNC chairHow about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton Trump said These politicians Theres no loyalty there No loyalty None whatsoeverIt gets a little heat and they fire her Trump said Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didnt take more than five minutes to make that decisionWassermans Republican counterpart Reince Priebus said I think the days events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this weekThe extreme left will not be satisfied by one persons resignation the Republican party national chairman addedTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the doorDebbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNCs email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign he said in a statement Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultzs lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroadDNC hack What you need to knowWeaver called Wasserman Schultzs departure a win on CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront on SundayI think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard he said And other people frankly in the party Hillary Clinton supporters who felt this was the last straw that she had to go and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November  united to deal with the problem of Donald TrumpWasserman Schultzs stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly  emailsOne email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreementSanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary ClintonSanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton  the announcement Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position hes held for months Wasserman Schultz needs to goI dont think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people and I dont think her leadership style is doing that Sanders told Tapper on State of the Union on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in PhiladelphiaI am not an atheist he said But aside from all of that it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign It goes without saying The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates  to be fair and evenmindedHe added But again we discussed this many many months ago on this show so what is revealed now is not a shock to me,Dems open convention without Wasserman Schultz,Real
It’s Billy Bush’s snickering that really gets to me In the video from  published Friday by The Washington Post you can hear Mr Bush first cousin to George W wheezing ecstatically as Donald J Trump brags inadvertently into a hot mic about sexually harassing and groping women The pair along with a passel of unidentified men are on a bus en route to film an Access Hollywood segment with the actress Arianne ZuckerThrough the window of the bus Mr Bush seems to spot Ms Zucker first as she waits to greet them “Sheesh” he blurts breathless telling Mr Trump how hot “your girl” is You can feel Mr Bush’s giddiness a contact high at getting to join a more powerful man in the oldest and most sacred of male bonding exercises objectifying womenMr Trump spies Ms Zucker too “Whoa”“Yes” Mr Bush grunts Beavisesque “Yes the Donald has scored”Of course “the Donald” has not “scored” The Donald is on the NBC lot to shoot a guest appearance on “Days of Our Lives” at the behest of his employer to promote his reality show “The Apprentice” while “Access Hollywood” produces an accompanying puff piece This is work within work within work Mr Bush is at work Mr Trump is at work Ms Zucker is at work

Comments About WomenPublish Date October   Photo by Mark Makela for The New York Times Watch in Times Video »“I gotta use some Tic Tacs” Mr Trump says still inside the bus “just in case I start kissing her You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them it’s like a magnet Just kiss I don’t even wait And when you’re a star they let you do it You can do anything Grab them by the pussy You can do anything” Mr Bush and the bus toadies laughYou can’t “do anything” actually This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde it’s practically medieval but women are allowed to own property now That includes our own bodies whether you feel “automatically” entitled to pieces of us or notEvery woman knows a version of Donald Trump Most of us have known more of them than we can or care to recall He’s the boss who thinks you owe him something the date who thinks that silence means “yes” and “no” means “try harder” the stranger who thinks your body’s mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch take own and destroy He’s every deadbeat hookup every narcissistic loser every man who’s ever tried to leverage power money fame credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach He’s the man who held you back who never took you seriously who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anywayCome on women You know this man I can name the ones in my past — name yours and imagine each as president with every woman’s life in his care Would you even trust him to watch your dog That’s a trick question because he would never do it His defining characteristic is that he does not care about youWhen Mr Trump tells Mr Bush that he’s “gotta use a Tic Tac” just in case he cannot restrain himself from nonconsensually affixing his perfectly round gasping lamprey mouth over Ms Zucker’s he is talking about sexually assaulting a coworkerWhen he says he grabs women’s genitals he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like at any time Female Trump voters It’s fine if you’ve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party but what about your daughters Is that the life you want for them You want old men to grab their genitals You want the president of the United States to go around grabbing genitalsMr Trump is rape culture’s blathering id and Sunday night Hillary Clinton who no doubt has just as many manmade scars as the rest of us has to stand next to him on a stage and remain unflappable as she’s held to an astronomically higher standard and pretend that he is her equal while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth While Mr Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs Clinton’s smile — a constant churning microanalysis of nothingMany people well many men are expressing their disgust with Mr Trump the only way they know how By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters — people presumably with the anatomy Mr Trump feels free to assess and knead Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year and all her life that sure women can be cherished if you want but they also can be presidentMeanwhile rightwing lawmakers are scrambling sanctimonious and pathetic to distance themselves from their own hideous progeny clearly hoping to salvage some personal credibility and perhaps even save their party But here is the thing the big thing that Paul D Ryan and Reince Priebus and Mike Pence and all the spineless Billy Bushes of the world and plenty of progressive men too for that matter don’t understand Most of you are no better than Mr Trump you are just more subtleIf you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally you are no better If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism xenophobia transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign but now you’re mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another man’s wife you are no better If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing you are no better If you

I like authenticity especially as compared to surveytested or heavily spun I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I don’t completely agree with and still support him or her I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthfulI think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story both economically and politically and that lobbyists have way too much sway I am very much a pragmatist so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology I like deals especially those that are winwin So Donald Trump is my candidate right He is NOTIn  when I was  years old and he was  Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project a shopping center which like everything else was to bear his name Trump Centre It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm which is now over  years old This was at a time when Trump still built things having recently finished Trump Tower  my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words “want me”He seemed to me smart business savvy decisive He had a very impressive office a fancy and very big boat an airline a helicopter shuttle and several casinos Within a few years virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump lots and lots I am no Roy Cohn  neither as aggressive nor hopefully nearly as ethicallychallenged  but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey I was thrilled when he hired meAfter the initial interview my client contact with Donald was actually not very much One low point I do remember actually will never forget is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words “want me” I was just plain shocked and embarrassed but I kept smiling I wanted and needed this client happy While I was working for Donald various press reports had Trump and his thenwife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of   and even  or  rooms Genuinely curious I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had I will never forget his response to me “However many they will print”Donald Trump was then as he is now larger than life particularly in his own eyes and at the same time frighteningly small with very little moral grounding He was then and still is all ego and show I once asked him how many rooms  apartment actually had I will never forget his response to me “However many they will print”I have thought about this a lot and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States To me it is more about character than politics Because of lack of the former the latter  the actual politics of Donald Trump  are not that easy to discernOnce I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country it was hard to stop I did stop however when I hit  about  words from here Read on if you are  The man lies all the timeLike the skilled liar he is he does it with impunity “I watched in Jersey City NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed” “The last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero” “The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is  million it could be  million” “ The Mexican government forces bad people into our country” “The unemployment rate may be as high as  percent” All these things have been said by Donald actually often yelled by him and many times over and over in front of large crowds How about the whopper “Crime statistics show blacks kill  percent of white homicide victims” One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived much less told Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully so they must be true But they are not Unambiguously they are what is described as “pants on fire” untruthful as in not a shred of truth In passing you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald Trump’s oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth Clearly “thou shall not lie” is not his favorite of the Ten  It is actually not all about the candidate“It’s amazing how often I am right” “I alone can fix this” “I have a big brain” “I advise myself” “I am very very rich” Donald really said all these things His ego seems to know no bounds When Donald feels insulted by someone he obsesses without control He fusses he fumes and he says unbelievably inappropriate things He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covetsHis ego seems to know no bounds When Donald feels insulted by someone he obsesses without controlDid you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met struggling with a difficult problem are just not in the Trump lexicon He keeps telling us he is all about winners I guess these folks don’t qualify Said another way Donald Trump doesn’t play well in the sandbox with othersFirst he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him He also wants to run the sandbox He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff What happens when he figures out even our nation’s highest office is not all about him Do we want him with the codes to nuclear  US presidents are by design not kings The Constitution makes them share power Donald Trump who uses the “I” word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job has a brazenly authoritarian bent He wants to be a “strongman” not a president One has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no What then of his notoriously short attention span temper or nonstop need to tweet his every  The devil IS in the detailsJONATHAN DRAKE  REUTERSDonald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville North Carolina March  “Winning so much we will get tired of winning” “Make good deals with China” or even “Make America great again” are slogans that don’t actually say anything We are not stupid share some details with us so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about For Donald however in the few instances when specifics do follow like perhaps the   foot wall or the deportation of  million immigrants the details never comeNever are we told that to build the wall even to the lower  feet by actual construction estimates would cost  billion dollars even if you could get the land to build it most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fenceHis magic to make Mexico pay for it The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his “ percent tariffs” How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying  percent more for Mexicanmade merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration more of which is “overstays” of visitors than “over the border” and likely will generate few if any jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy Then let’s take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff How exactly do you round up and deport  million people Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines Who will be doing the rounding up certainly not the police the army perhaps The children left behind How about the fact that American farms restaurants not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended Vital jobs for sure but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his “real Americans” to make America great  Words matterEverything is not a “disaster” “stupid” or a “disgrace” Neither is it “tremendous” “huge” “fantastic” or “amazing” Everyone is not a “loser” “low energy” or a “bimbo” Talk of former presidents being liars  or his favorite “a disaster”  and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse Americans are mostly not prudes but vulgarity from the dais penis size allusions reveling in sexual conquests menstruationbased criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president We have  Reading is good So is studyingDonald Trump recently told us that he does not read much We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal yes I do have my copy from when it first came out autographed with Donald telling me to “keep up the great work” which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the mustread book that he certainly has not written a book  at least not that oneIt is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the jobEven though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers I do not believe you must read to lead I do believe however that those who seek to lead us need to study hard seek to gain wisdom from others and try to master very complex ideas and relationships I think being president is hard I am glad that after a long day President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for  or  hours of quiet study and reading Any fair interpretation of Trump’s many bizarre statements and flipflops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study In his own words he makes decisions “with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had plus the words ‘common sense’ because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability” It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job  The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good oneXenophobe intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries misogynist strong prejudice against women nativist preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants fascist authoritarian and dictatorial bigot intolerance for those with a

oh you know what this one is We have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark What happened to statesmanlike wellqualified or even brilliant as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office Haven’t heard any of these associated with the  We need to be careful with “tough”Donald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies “in the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher” His world reveres this brand of toughness This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions It is about “punching that guy in the face” or at a minimum saving face  his I will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again and rather just query do we really want a thinskinned president who as he suggested if a government leader Castro was not on the tarmac to meet his plane “would turn around Air Force One and come home” Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless retweet of a white supremacistcreated Jewish star and dollar billbacked attack of Hillary Clinton was antiSemitic can’t even just give one of those nonapologyapologies “I am sorry if I offended anyone” A “toughguy” who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element highfiving him and resending his initial offensive post Whether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support Trump demonstrates his version of tough one that

his skills limited Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showmanpromoter in a league only with PT Barnum This we can give him He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use For a while he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired However even in his own playing field ask any large New York real estate developer of which—surprise

bills fully or on time or that he calls himself the “King of Debt”  a king made rich by running up debt then renegotiating it Is this the skill set we want for the presidentEven with Trump’s fabled net worth always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldn’t be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it We’ll never know from Donald  certainly not from those tax returns he won’t  We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment but our media may kill usThe media is not Donald’s enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage It may be the enemy of the rest of us however It sure feels like it lately The air time Donald gets and his ability to phone in his rants especially with the cable media is nothing short of to use one of his words “disgusting” Donald who lives by polls and ratings understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves Donald dominates almost every news cycle simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else The “false equivalency” created by pointcounterpoint talking heads then makes overthetop positions seem legitimate It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of  Temperament demeanor and character are importantIn many ways Donald represents the very worst in all of us or at least many of us He is all about continuous gratification He is the petulant child who wants his way He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet He is the spoiled young man of privilege

generals” Please can some real soldiers evaluate thisDonald says America never wins anymore Compared to whom and at what No doubt we have problems Democracy is messy Witness the present campaign and the long slow recovery from the  recession has not included the middle class nearly enough And yes trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out But by what measure is America as Donald tells us a “disaster”How do you actually say and believe “This country is a hellhole We are going down fast” Compared to whom Mexico China or his most bizarre new favorite Russia that he tells us “beat us all the time  because our leaders are stupid” Give us a break  Sophomoric speech tricks don’t work  at least not with most of usSays Donald “I am not going to talk about” the libertarian VP candidate’s alcoholism “I refuse to say I cannot stand to say that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time” You just did Donald We get it that with these statements even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways Doesn’t work Nor does your even more insidious notsoclever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make but that you want to advance How about when discussing the Orlando massacre “there are a lot of people that think  doesn’t want to get it A lot of people think maybe he doesn’t want to know about it I happen to think he just doesn’t know what he is doing but there are many people that think maybe he just doesn’t want to get it He doesn’t want to see what’s really happening And that could be” Who are these “people” who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists Perhaps the same people who with Trump saw the masses in New Jersey

President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia Two possibilities The likely one “lots of people are saying” is just Trump code for “I want to now float something so outrageous” even redfaced Donald can’t get it out without this qualifier Or perhaps the “lots of people” is a select group the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him  A thin skin does not work for a president“The politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee” So said the longdefunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln now nearly everybody’s choice for our nation’s best president Consider the statement when George Washington left office “the time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our country…  reduced to a level with his fellow citizens”US presidents all of them have had their critics and in our land of wonderful free speech the critics get to have their say Thank goodness That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate Ask Megyn Kelly “thirdrate talent” Rosie O’Donnell “nice little fat Rosie” “total loser” or Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries Cruz Kasich Rubio or Bush in just the first tier Even the one most like him now apparently looking for a postNew Jersey job with him Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was “thinskinned” He just can’t let anything go ever He obsesses even when he wins Republicans who broke “the pledge” to support him they “should not be allowed to run for office again” In Donald’s world disagreeing with him has to have a consequence  a serious one  and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy even when it makes no difference Do we really think our president has time for this Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of say the FBI or the IRS Does the concept of “secret police” a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere seem too extreme Probably yes But if I was Donald I would float it with one of his “people are saying” declarations There I just used his trick See how easy it is  Bullies will always exist somewhere but the White House should not be that somewhereWhat does a bully do Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate physically or at least verbally So far this character trait of Donald’s has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists  and of course then exghost writer of his book and exemployees or contractors he cheated those who do not have antidisparagement contractual handcuffs who dare to candidly assess his conduct What happens when this guy gets the world’s strongest army at his disposal and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice Seem like a bad idea to anyone  Law and orderBefore it was an Emmywinning TV show “law and order” was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in  to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations even riots in  US cities Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the “silent majority” around the need for more police He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and “elite Eastern liberals” and the evil media that his vice president Spiro Agnew called “nattering nabobs of negativism” Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back Of course yes yet noYes he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture No because his dystopian version of lawless besieged pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached nor for that matter Ronald Reagan It is unique to him at least in our country It is however a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen It is a demagogue’s basic tool to gin up a problem then declare he is the “only one who can fix it” As bad as all this rhetoric is what next He tells us “On January   the day I take the oath of office Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soonI mean very sooncome to an end” How’s this work Donald Martial law Does he honestly believe President Obama and for that matter all of his  predecessors would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed If only wishing could make it so However since the states not the federal government hold sway over most criminal law the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing What then More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic “I alone can fix it” Incoherent rants often contradictory does not a foreign policy makeConvince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms Eliminate NATO Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground Sometimes attack Libya sometimes not Sometimes attack surgically but don’t let it come out the way it did Sometimes it’s good we attacked Iraq sometimes not Do not nation build but fix Syria Stop Iran by making better deals In fact come to think of it that is the solution to almost everything “just make better deals” everywhere Oh yes and never apologize for anything We are America very very rich and beholden to no one Like us or else Sound like someone we know  How will anyone effectively be president if we don’t at least respect the officeIn the  during an unpopular war we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America including me somehow unAmerican Although political opposition is as old as our nation we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification This Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists Any thoughtful American of either party or no party of any political philosophy must see that this must stop Truth or at least a semblance of some has to come back Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse  outrageous liars even less so They cannot become the backbone of a pointcounterpoint talkinghead media circus that is so much more about ratings than  Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules tooLet’s not kid ourselves Trump University was not an academic institution far from it It was a getrichquick scheme by a guy selling a getrichquick scheme It is not the first or the last of its type Late night cheapadvertisingtimetelevision will always feature this fare Donald’s efforts however were on so much a grander scale   “a university” Really What this was is an outandout fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world We all know or at least have read that suckers are born every minute But can’t we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks and when they really go too far sue them “No” says Donald Trump The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court Donald says because the longtime and distinguished federal judge is a “hater” not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from MexicoIn Donald’s world the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico likewise folks of the Muslim faith and oh yeah likewise women In this world rich entitled egotistical ethicallychallenged older white men should then only be judged by rich entitled egotistical ethicallychallenged older white  We must stand for somethingDonald Trump’s version of America does not include folks not like him Instead he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled “real Americans” The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling Targeting an entire religion  Islam with  billion adherents  million being US citizens  for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values if not those of the “real Americans”It is also unconstitutional and beyond all this incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp Other similar strategies championed by Donald like waterboarding and other forms of torture not to mention targeting families of an enemy are not just illegal They are to use another one of his words “stupid” They do not work very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionateOne has to wonder what does the America of the “real Americans” look like A bunch of intolerant hyper aggressive folks behind a big wall isolated not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods and with a lot of enemies No “Shining City on the Hill” for sure Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a placeWe can do so much better For me better comes easily in the form of former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton For those who do not come to that conclusion easily I get it this year it will have to be the lesser of two evils No matter what don’t even think about taking us into the abyss that is Donald Trump ,Donald Trump If I lose I dont think you will ever see me again,Real
Dont expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nominationDuring a Sunday rally in Maryland the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches saying that if he loses the contest Americans will probably not hear much from him againThey fight like hell for six months and theyre saying horrible things the worst things you can imagine Trump said And then one of them loses one of them wins And the one who loses says I just want to congratulate my opponent He is a brilliant man hell be a great governor or president or whateverHe continued Im not sure youre ever going to see me there I dont think Im going to lose but if I do I dont think youre ever going to see me again folks I think Ill go to Turnberry and play golf or somethingTrumps mockery wasnt relegated just to the electoral losers He also said Sunday that the winners were too modestHalf the times  put them in the administration — thats how they get rid of them Trump said of the losing candidatesThis line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race Trump frequently touts his support from Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben CarsonDuring a news conference in February announcing Christies endorsement Trump lauded Christies tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debatesGenerally speaking Im not big on endorsements Trump said adding This was an endorsement that really meant a lot,Donald Trump Hired Me As An Attorney Please Donâ€™t Support Him For President,Real
DONALD J TRUMP until now a Republican problem this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president in experience and temperament He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer not substance To the extent he has views they are wrong in their diagnosis of America’s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions Mr Trump’s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nation’s twocenturyold experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knewAny one of these characteristics would be disqualifying together they make Mr Trump a peril We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement In an ordinary election year we would acknowledge the Republican nominee move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months like other voters evaluating the candidates’ performance in debates on the stump and in position papers This year we will follow the campaign as always offering honest views on all the candidates But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the worldWhy are we so sure Start with experience It has been  years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience That experiment turned out pretty well — but Mr Trump to put it mildly is no Dwight David Eisenhower Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order and Eisenhower — though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson — was shrewd diligent humble and thoughtfulIn contrast there is nothing on Mr Trump’s résumé to suggest he could function successfully in Washington He was staked in the family business by a welltodo father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns breaking with a long bipartisan tradition it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we knowThe lack of experience might be overcome if Mr Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming But he displays no curiosity reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice In fact what makes Mr Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views He also is contemptuous of fact Throughout the campaign he has unspooled one lie after another — that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after  that his taxcut plan would not worsen the deficit that he opposed the Iraq War before it started — and when confronted with contrary evidence he simply repeats the lie It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chiefGiven his ignorance it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy In years past he supported immigration reform gun control and legal abortion as candidate he became a hardline opponent of all three Even in the course of the campaign he has flipflopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished  Worse than the flipflops is the absence of any substance in his agenda Existing trade deals are “stupid” but Mr Trump does not say how they could be improved The Islamic State must be destroyed but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported but Mr Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practicallyWhat the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings most of them erroneous Allies are taking advantage of the United States Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs Muslims hate America In fact Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans Immigrants commit fewer crimes than nativeborn Americans and take jobs that no one else will Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism and Muslim Americans including thousands who have served in the military are as patriotic as anyone elseThe Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated They deserve a serious champion and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response But Mr Trump has nothing positive to offer only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year sinceIn a dangerous world Mr Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm For eight years Republicans have criticized President Obama for “apologizing” for America and for weakening alliances Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought The consequences to global security could be disastrousMost alarming is Mr Trump’s contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends He doesn’t know what is in the nation’s founding document When asked by a member of Congress about Article I which enumerates congressional powers the candidate responded “I am going to abide by the Constitution whether it’s number  number  number  number ” The charter has seven articlesWorse he doesn’t seem to care about its limitations on executive power He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives no matter the illegality of either act He has vowed to constrict the independent press He went after a judge whose rulings angered him exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage Mr Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies The US democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before We have faith in it But to elect Mr Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threatMr Trump campaigns by insult and denigration insinuation and wild accusation Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of President John F Kennedy Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder Mr Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy dependsMost responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true that is why Mr Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this week’s Republican convention With one exception Bob Dole the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away But most current officeholders even those who declared Mr Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago have lost the courage to speak outThe party’s failure of judgment leaves the nation’s future where it belongs in the hands of voters Many Americans do not like either candidate this year  We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the past and will do so again when warranted But we do not believe that she or the Libertarian and Green party candidates for that matter represents a threat to the Constitution Mr Trump is a unique and present danger,Donald Trump is a unique threat to American democracy,Real
Donald Trump is going to be elected presidentThe American people voted for him a long time agoThey voted for him when The History Channel went from showing documentaries about the Second World War to “Pawn Stars” and “Swamp People”They voted for him when The Discovery Channel went from showing “Lost Treasures of the Yangtze Valley” to “Naked and Afraid”They voted for him when The Learning Channel moved from something you could learn from to “My  Life”They voted for him when CBS went from airing “Harvest of Shame” to airing “Big Brother”These networks didn’t make these programming changes by accident They were responding to what the American people actually wanted And what they wanted was “Naked and Afraid” and “Duck Dynasty”The polls may show that Donald Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton but don’t you believe those polls When the AC Nielsen Company selects a new Nielsen family they disregard the new family’s results for the first three months The reason when they feel they are being monitored people lie about what they are watching In the first three months knowing they are being watched they will tune into PBS But over time they get tired of pretending Then it is back to the KardashiansThe same goes for people who are being asked by pollsters for whom they are voting They will not say Donald Trump It is too embarrassing But the truth is they like Trump He is just like their favorite shows on TVMindless entertainmentTrump’s replacement of Paul Manafort with Breitbart’s Steve Bannon shows that Trump understands how Americans actually think They think TV They think ratings They think entertainmentWe are a TVbased culture We have been for some time now The average American spends  hours a day every day watching TV After sleep it is our number one activityMore shockingly we spend  hours a day staring at screens — phones tablets computers And more and more of the content on those devices is also video and TVIf you spend  hours a day every day for years and years doing the same thing it has an impact on you For the past  years we have devoted  hours a day staring at a screen — every day And we haven’t been watching Judy Woodruff We have been watching reality TV shows That is what we love That is what we resonate to “The Real Housewives of Atlanta”The French may love food The Italians may love opera What we love is TV We are TV culture It defines who we areIn the  early television was allowed with many restrictions to be an observational guest at political conventions They were quiet “flies on the wall” carefully and quietly commentating on what they saw way down below They did not get involved in the process Today they ARE the process Today political conventions are nothing but carefully directed TV shows Likewise “debates” They exist only to entertain a TV audience TV and entertainment now dictate everything political It is a neverending show The biggest reality show on airAnd Donald Trump is great TVHe knows how to entertainHe understands ratingsHillary Clinton is crap TVShe may be smarter better prepared a better politician It won’t matter She is terrible entertainmentThat’s just how it is Depressing but trueHe is Kim Kardashian She is Judy WoodruffWho gets better ratingsWho would you rather watch for the next four yearsHonestlyIn  the great French gastronom Brillat de Savarind said “Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are” Today in America we can safely say “Tell me what you watch and I will tell you what you are”And what do we watchIt isn’t “PBS NewsHour”,Donald Trump Is Going To Be Elected,Real
This is my last column until after the election so I’d like to address the people least likely to read it Donald Trump voters Who knows Maybe I’ll get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column and they’ll accidentally peruse it Desperate times call for desperate measuresWhile I’ve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start I’ve never disparaged Trump voters Some are friends and neighbors they’re all fellow Americans We should take their concerns seriously But we should also demand that they be serious that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidatesYes Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader — but in the way so many presidents were We know her flaws She has a weakness for secrecy occasionally fudges truths has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women But she is not indecent and that is an important distinction And she’s studious has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriouslyTrump is not only a flawed politician he’s an indecent human being He’s boasted of assaulting women — prompting  to come forward to testify that he did just that to them his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they weren’t pretty enoughHe’s created a university that was charged with defrauding its students He’s been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties He’s stiffed countless vendors from piano sellers to major contractors He’s refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that he’s paid no federal taxes for years is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesn’t give like he says to charityHe’s compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his “sacrifice” of building tall buildings He’s vowed if elected to prosecute his campaign rivalWe have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidateAt the same time Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth Harlan Coben’s debatenight tweet last month had it right “On Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read”I understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just “shake things up” When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to you can open new futures But when you shake things up guided by oneliners and no moral compass you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigoReceive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Timess products and servicesPRIVACY POLICYBut there is an even more important reason Trump supporters particularly lesseducated white males should be wary of his bluster His policies won’t help them Trump promises to bring their jobs back But most of their jobs didn’t go to a Mexican They went to a microchipThe idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the US economy Indeed our factories now produce twice what they did in  — but with onethird fewer workersTrump can’t change that Machines and software will keep devouring and spawning more work of all kinds Did you hear that IBM’s cognitive computer Watson helped to create a pop song “Not Easy” with the Grammywinning producer Alex da Kid The song was released on Oct  IBM noted and within  hours it climbed to No  on iTunes’s Hot TracksNo one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines but I can assure you it’s not Trump’s way — build walls restrict trade give huge tax cuts to the rich The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call “STEMpathy jobs — jobs that blend STEM skills science technology engineering math with human empathy We don’t know what many of them will look like yetThe smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible — to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the world’s most imaginative risktakers and strengthen our safety nets because this era will leave more people behindThis is the only true path to American greatness in the  century Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore “What do we have to lose” by trying his way Trump asks The answer is everything that actually makes us great When the world gets this fast small errors in navigation have huge consequencesWhile Clinton has failed to inspire her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course And however great her flaws she is still in the zone of human decency Trump is notWe can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters my fellow Americans will see that,Donald Trump Voters Just Hear Me Out,Real

Tonight Donald J Trump accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president of the United StatesAnd I am for the first time since I began covering American politics genuinely afraidDonald Trump is not a man who should be president This is not an ideological judgment This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio This is not a disagreement over Donald Trump’s tax plan or his climate policies This is about Trump’s character his temperament his impulsiveness his basic decencyBack in February I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament hes a racist a sexist and a demagogue but hes also a narcissist a bully and a dilettante He lies so constantly and so fluently that its hard to know if he even realizes hes lying He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlashHe has had plenty of time to prove me and everyone else wrong But he hasn’t He has not become more responsible or more sober more decent or more generous more considered or more informed more careful or more kind He has continued to retweet white supremacists make racist comments pick unnecessary fights contradict himself on the stump and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policyHe has instead run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesnt actually exist His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end he said Beginning on January   safety will be restoredHere is what we know — truly know — about Trump Here is why he should not be presidentTrump is vindictive So far the unifying theme of Trump’s convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail Trump didn’t like the Washington Post’s coverage of his campaign so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Posts owner Jeff BezosHe was upset that Ohio didn’t vote for him so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats even though the state is hosting the convention He was angry about an interview his exghostwriter gave to the New Yorker so he sent his lawyers after him He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who suckerpunched one of themImagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency Imagine what he could do — what he would do — to those who crossed himTrump is a bigot Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists He responded to Ted Cruz’s surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel He sought to discredit a USborn judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his Mexican heritage Trump’s campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his party’s nominee said as the textbook definition of a racist commentThis is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse worldTrump is a sexist Stories of Trump’s casual sexism abound but during the campaign it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny The first Republican debate for instance was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly Bret Baier and Chris Wallace Kelly wasn’t obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues but she was the antagonist he focused on retweeting a follower who said she was a bimbo and saying she had blood coming out of her … whereverAfter Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate Trump said to Rolling Stone Look at that face Would anyone vote for that Can you imagine that the face of our next president After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate Trump told the crowd Its too disgusting Dont say it its disgustingIt’s not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was ou have to treat em like shitTrump is a liar Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War But he didn’t On September   Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq Yeah I guess so he replied Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere He just lies about this and he does so oftenBut that’s true for Trump across many issues He says his health care plan will insure everyone when it will do nothing of the kind He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply Trump has lied about his net worth his reasons for not releasing his tax returns and his charitable donations He lies easily fluently shamelessly constantlyTrump is a narcissist Trump’s towering selfregard worked for him as a real estate developer His real business was licensing his name out for building menswear golf courses steaks A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidateThe most recent example was the  minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence his vice presidential candidate for the first time The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorismTrump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism When MSNBCs Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin who kills journalists political opponents and invades countries Trump replied Hes running his country and at least hes a leader unlike what we have in this countryBut it’s not just Putin Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because he killed terrorists He did that so good They didnt read them the rights He said youve got to give  credit He goes in he takes over and hes the boss Its incredible It’s not just that Trump admires these authoritarians it’s that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism — their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press due process and political oppositionTrump is a conspiracy theorist Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd birther movement He’s said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack Obama’s Dreams From My Father explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over  percent and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murderedTrump is very very gullible This is related to his conspiracy theories but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the timeThis has led to among other things Trump retweeting false crime statistics Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted Cruz’s dad helped kill JFK When pressed about these sundry embarrassments Trump said All I know is what’s on the internetThat’s a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains but not from a presidential candidateTrump doesn’t apologize and his defensiveness escalates situations On Monday night it became very clear that Melania Trump’s  convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle Obama’s  convention speech The error was an embarrassment but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizingInstead the Trump campaign turned it into a multiday story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton This is an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton how she seeks out to demean her and take her down said campaign chair Paul Manafort in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American historyThe campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesn’t own the English language and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle a My Little Pony I’m serious Finally days later the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriterA similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an antiHillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption The image was obviously antiSemitic and the Trump campaign quickly took it down But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriff’s star or maybe just a regular old star and that the campaign shouldn’t have removed the offending meme in the first placeSo far these examples are farce but as Tim Lee writes this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy  behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations Instead his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way That might work in some cases But in others — especially against powerful countries like China or Russia — the results could be disastrousTrump surrounds himself with sycophants Its tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency On December  Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial customIf elected Mr Trump I can state unequivocally will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency Dr Harold Bornstein writes His blood pressure  and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent … His physical strength and stamina are extraordinaryThis is … not how most doctor notes read Reached for comment regarding this a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled reported the Daily BeastThere are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony But personal physician should not be one of them The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends But more than that it should disqualify him from the presidencyTrump has proven too lazy to learn about policy Trump didn’t know much about policy when the campaign started and as far as anyone can tell he hasn’t made any obvious effort to rectify thatThe latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia It’s not obvious Trump meant to say that or even knew what saying that meant as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that yes Trump had said itBut this is a pattern for Trump who doesn’t bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president As Matt Yglesias wrote this is very much a choice Trump has made Trump is now the GOP nominee and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper betterinformed candidate It doesn’t happen because he can’t be botheredTrump has run an incompetent campaign and convention As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters he hasn’t bothered to build a real campaign organization and his convention has been a festival of unforced errorsThis is the context of Melania Trump’s plagiarism of Ted Cruz’s antiendorsement of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton In isolation these are gaffes mistakes bad luck Together though they tell a damning story of organizational incompetenceThe most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization but he’s just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that don’t engage him His former ghostwriter says He has no attention span Unfortunately the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasksTrump is a bully Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts There was lowenergy Jeb and Little Marco and Lyin’ Ted and now we’ve got Crooked Hillary Trump made fun of Rand Paul’s looks and Chris Christie’s weight and Carly Fiorina’s face and a New York Times reporter’s physical disabilityIt seems like this shouldn’t have to be said but it’s better to be kind than cruel and there’s a deep instinctual cruelty in Trump — he finds people’s weak spots their insecurities and he exposes them in front of crowdsTrump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters At a rally in St Louis Donald Trump lamented that nobody wants to hurt each other anymoreYes lamentedThe topic was protesters and Trumps frustration was clear Theyre being politically correct the way they take them out he sighed Protesters they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore There used to be consequences There are none anymoreEarlier in the campaign two of Trump’s supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police Donald Trump was right — all these illegals need to be deported Trump’s response I will say that people who are following me are very passionate They love this country and they want this country to be great againThe simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States That is not because he is too conservative as some Democrats would have it or because he is not conservative enough as many Republicans would have it It’s because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility He has failedIt is said that the benefit of America’s long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are Trump has shown us who he really is He is a person who should not be president That he is being brought this close to the presidency — that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it — should scare us all It certainly scares me,Donald Trumps nomination is the first time American politics has left me truly afraid,Real
Conservatives’ efforts to recruit a candidate to compete against Donald Trump may have only been able to come up with David French a National Review writer who is merely contemplating the possibility of running But last week a new potential candidate stepped up to the stage if not for this race possibly for a future one Dwayne Johnson the actor formerly known by his professional wrestling moniker The Rock told British GQ that he’s considered a different kind of career“I’ll be honest I haven’t ruled politics out I’m not being coy when I say that but at the moment I am not sure” Johnson said “I can’t deny that the thought of being governor the thought of being president is alluring And beyond that it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people’s lives on a global scale But there are a lot of other things I want to do first”The prospect of yet another former realitytelevision star running for higher office may feel improbable at best and horrifying at worst given Trump’s performance in the  campaign thus far And I can’t vouch for Johnson’s position on the issues — though he’s registered as a Republican and has appeared at the Republican convention to boost voter registration he’s generally talked less about actual policy and spent more time flashing his famously winning smileBut just as I was an early champion of Johnson’s acting abilities — he’s fascinating as a gay closeted driver in “Be Cool” mesmerizing as a an amnesiac who is not doing well in the postapocalypse in “Southland Tales” and one of the funniest parts of Michael Bay’s wildly underrated “Pain  Gain” — I’ve long thought that Johnson had a weirdly plausible path to a political careerHe grew up all around the country because of his father’s job but makes his home in Florida an important state in presidential election years and the place where he played football for the University of Miami The locker room was named for him after he made a major donation Since his pivot to movie stardom Johnson has become one of the most consistently likable celebrities in America as measured by the Q Scores Company he’d begin any race not just with high name recognition but also with high favorable ratings Johnson is even descended from James Bowles a free black man who fought with the British during the Revolutionary War when the kingdom offered land and freedom to black Americans who joined their side His mother’s side of the family is SamoanFor a Republican Party that was desperate to woo nonwhite voters before Donald Trump tossed his toupee in the ring and will be even harderpressed to woo them once our present mess is over Johnson could be the sort of person the GOP tries to renovate into a viable candidateIf he doesn’t have policy or issue bona fides Johnson’s relative silence on substance also means he doesn’t have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flipflopper And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions It’s easier to teach talking points than charisma as Sen Ted Cruz RTex experienced earlier this yearOf course if he really was going to try to follow Ronald Reagan’s path to the presidency Johnson would certainly have to run for something else first And he could do it as early as this year Johnson has until June  to get on the primary ballot in Florida and join the candidates who are competing for the Senate seat Marco Rubio decided to vacate when he ran for presidentThe prospect of The Rock sitting through committee hearings might be vaguely ridiculous and a governorship would probably require him to take fewer potentially damaging votes But the lesson of this year in American politics is that stranger things can always happen And Trump is proof that if our politics are turning into realitytelevision competitions the results could always be worse,Dwayne Johnson says he might want to run for president He could actually win,Real

Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the “Lolita Express”  even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by FoxNewscomClinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including “Tatiana” The trickedout jet earned its Nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls“Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein who everyone in New York certainly within his inner circles knew was a pedophile” said Conchita Sarnoff of the Washington DC based nonprofit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking and author of a book on the Epstein case called TrafficKing “Why would a former president associate with a man like that”Virginia Roberts  who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age  has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epstein’s getaway in  but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St Thomas the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epsteins plane They do show Clinton flying aboard Epstein’s plane to such destinations as Hong Kong Japan Singapore China Brunei London New York the Azores Belgium Norway Russia and AfricaAmong those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epstein’s associates New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein’s assistant Sarah Kellen both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friendsIn response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNewscom the US Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with ClintonA Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former president’s relationship and travels with Epstein The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clinton’s travel recordsMartin Weinberg Epstein’s current attorney did not respond to multiple inquiries Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates “have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks allegations and plain inventions”Police in Palm Beach Fla launched a yearlong investigation in  into Epstein after parents of a  girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him Police interviewed dozens of witnesses confiscated his trash performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion ultimately identifying  girls between the ages of  and  who they said were sexually abused by EpsteinIn  at the request of Palm Beach Police the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had “used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of  and  to engage in illegal sexual activities”According to court documents police investigators found a “clear indication that Epstein’s staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of  and  years old literally every day often two or three times per day”One victim in sworn deposition testimony said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was  years old and molested her on more than  occasions over the next three years The girls testified they were lured to Epstein’s home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse but when they arrived he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on themThe US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse witness tampering and money laundering but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed upOn Sept   in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency Epstein agreed to a  sentence including  months of jail time and  months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuseIn exchange the US Attorney’s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his coconspiratorsFlorida attorney Brad Edwards who represented some of Epstein’s alleged victims is suing the federal government over the secret nonprosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims “to prevent them from voicing any objection and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politicallyconnected billionaire and all of his coconspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls”The US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the dealOther politicians celebrities and businessmen including presidential candidate Donald Trump have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNewscom in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals“There was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump” he said “They were not friends and they did not socialize together”,Flight logs show Bill

In any normal election year we’d compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues But this is not a normal election year A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate — our choice Hillary Clinton — has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas and the other Donald Trump discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American historyBut this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters We’re aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs Clinton — because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat or for another Clinton or for a candidate who might appear on the surface not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems brokenRunning down the other guy won’t suffice to make that argument The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be and is not that she isn’t Donald TrumpThe best case is instead about the challenges this country faces and Mrs Clinton’s capacity to rise to themCan Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe SEPT   next president will take office with bigoted tribalist movements and their leaders on the march In the Middle East and across Asia in Russia and Eastern Europe even in Britain and the United States war terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charityThe  campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middleclass Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession technological change foreign competition and war have heaped on their familiesOver  years in public life Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect experience toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service often as the first or only woman in the arena,HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT,Real
It seems we’re entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervalsMy background is archaeology so also history and anthropology It leads me to look at big historical patterns My theory is that most peoples’ perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents so  years To go beyond that you have to read study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history In a nutshell at university I would fail a paper if I didn’t compare at least two if not three opposing views on a topic Taking one telling of events as gospel doesn’t wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia I can’t speak for other systems but they’re definitely not all alike in this waySo zooming out we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction generally selfimposed to some extent or another This handy list shows all the wars over time Wars are actually the norm for humans but every now and then something big comes along I am interested in the Black Death which devastated Europe The opening of Boccaccio’s Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague It is as beyond imagination as the Somme Hiroshima or the Holocaust I mean you quite literally can’t put yourself there and imagine what it was like For those in the midst of the Plague it must have felt like the end of the world a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger creating a cult around himselfBut a defining feature of humans is their resilience To us now it seems obvious that we survived the Plague but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards Indeed many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term Well summed up hereBy targeting frail people of all ages and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe” In addition the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people This shortage caused wages to rise Products prices fell too Consequently standards of living increased For instance people started to consume more food of higher qualityBut for the people living through it as with the World Wars Soviet Famines Holocaust it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it The collapse of the Roman Empire Black Death Spanish Inquisition Thirty Years War War of the Roses English Civil War it’s a long list Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on often in better shapeAt a local level in time people think things are fine — then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves For the people living in the midst of this it is hard to see happening and hard to understand To historians later it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of  million peopleMy point is that this is a cycle It happens again and again but as most people only have a  year historical perspective they don’t see that it’s happening again As the events that led to the First World War unfolded there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war but they were dismissed as hysterical mad or fools as is always the way and as people who worry about Putin Brexit and Trump are dismissed nowA little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you’d listened and thought a bitThen after the War to end all Wars we went and had another one Again for a historian it was quite predictable Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny people look for scapegoats a charismatic leader captures the popular mood and singles out that scapegoat He talks in rhetoric that has no detail and drums up anger and hatred Soon the masses start to move as one without any logic driving their actions and the whole becomes unstoppableThat was Hitler but it was also Mussolini Stalin Putin Mugabe and so many more Mugabe is a very good case in point He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority who happened to know how to run farms and seized their land to redistribute to the people in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land but starving See also the famines created by the Soviet Union and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which  million people died It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason but we do it again and againBut at the time people don’t realize they’re embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period They think they’re right they’re cheered on by jeering angry mobs their critics are mocked This cycle the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille to the rise of Hitler to the Second World War appears to be happening again But as with before most people cannot see it  They are only looking at the present not the past or  They are only looking immediately around them not at how events connect  Most people don’t read think challenge or hear opposing viewsTrump is doing this in America Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening Read this brilliant long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this and it is happening just as he predicted Trump says he will Make America Great Again when in fact America is currently great according to pretty well any statistics He is using passion anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did — a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger creating a cult around himself You can blame society politicians the media for America getting to the point that it’s ready for Trump but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the bossOn a wider stage zoom out some more Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself Turkey is now there too Hungary Poland Slovakia are heading that way and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings in fact funded by Putin waiting for the popular tide to turn their wayWe should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction We see Brexit Trump Putin in isolation The world does not work that way — all things are connected and affecting each other I have proBrexit friends who say “Oh you’re going to blame that on Brexit too” But they don’t realize that actually yes historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like BrexitWe are entering a bad phase It will be unpleasant for those living through it maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imaginationBrexit — a group of angry people winning a fight — easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight empowered with the idea that they may win That alone can trigger chain reactions A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split The exponential increase in atoms splitting and their combined energy is the bomb That is how World War One started and ironically how World War Two endedAn example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be thisBrexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum Le Pen wins an election in France Europe now has a fractured EU The EU for all its many awful faults has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putin’s military ambitions European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy and helped temper Russia’s attacks on Ukraine there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union Trump wins in the US Trump becomes isolationist which weakens NATO He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the BalticsWith a fractured EU and weakened NATO Putin facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people He funds far right antiEU activists in Latvia who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country the EU border with Russia Russia sends “peace keeping forces” and “aid lorries” into Latvia as it did in Georgia and in Ukraine He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine Crimea has the same population as Latvia by the wayA divided Europe with the leaders of France Hungary Poland Slovakia and others now proRussia antiEU and funded by Putin overrule calls for sanctions or a military response NATO is slow to respond Trump does not want America to be involved and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action Russia seeing no real resistance to their actions move further into Latvia and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate as they have now been invaded so have no choice Half of Europe sides with them a few countries remain neutral and a few side with Russia Where does Turkey stand on this How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe Who uses a nuclear weapon firstThis is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts And of course many of them lead to nothing happening But based on history we are due another period of destruction and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering oneIt will come in ways we can’t see coming and will spin out of control so fast people won’t be able to stop it Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so naïve How could I sit in a nice café in London writing this without wanting to run away How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how proRemain people should stop whining and how we shouldn’t blame everything on Brexit Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape that Trump is a possible future Hitler and yes Godwin’s Law But my comparison is to another narcissistic charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control It’s easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them It’s an easy route but the wrong oneIgnoring and mocking the experts as people are doing around Brexit and Trump’s campaign is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking and then finding later you’ve developed incurable cancer A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you’d listened and thought a bit But people smoke and people die from it That is the way of the humanWe need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups try to cross the ever widening social dividesSo I feel it’s all inevitable I don’t know what it will be but we are entering a bad phase It will be unpleasant for those living through it maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination Humans will come out the other side recover and move on The human race will be fine changed maybe better But for those at the sharp end — for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison for the Russian dissidents in gulags for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks for those yet to fall this will be their SommeWhat can we do Well again looking back probably not much The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority See Clay Shirky’s Twitter Storm on this point The people who see that open societies being nice to other people not being racist not fighting wars is a better way to live they generally end up losing these fights They don’t fight dirty They are terrible at appealing to the populace They are less violent so end up in prisons camps and graves We need to beware not to become divided see Labour party we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages We need to understand and use social mediaWe need to harness a different fear Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War  but didn’t We need to avoid our own echo chambers Trump and Putin supporters don’t read the Guardian so writing there is just reassuring our friends We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups try to cross the ever widening social

During a  career at the Central Intelligence Agency I served presidents of both parties — three Republicans and three Democrats I was at President George W Bush’s side when we were attacked on Sept  as deputy director of the agency I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in  am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican In my  years of voting I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties As a government official I have always been silent about my preference for presidentNo longer On Nov  I will vote for Hillary Clinton Between now and then I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our  presidentTwo strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision First Mrs Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe Second Donald J Trump is not only unqualified for the job but he may well pose a threat to our national securityI spent four years working with Mrs Clinton when she was secretary of state most often in the White House Situation Room In these critically important meetings I found her to be prepared detailoriented thoughtful inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argumentI also saw the secretary’s commitment to our nation’s security her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary and most important her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all — whether to put young American women and men in harm’s wayMrs Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in SyriaI never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room In fact I saw the opposite When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted she said “Screw the White House Correspondents Dinner”In sharp contrast to Mrs Clinton Mr Trump has no experience on national security Even more important the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor even dangerous commander in chiefThese traits include his obvious need for selfaggrandizement his overreaction to perceived slights his tendency to make decisions based on intuition his refusal to change his views based on new information his routine carelessness with the facts his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of lawThe dangers that flow from Mr Trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president It is already damaging our national securityPresident Vladimir V Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them That is exactly what he did early in the primaries Mr Putin played upon Mr Trump’s vulnerabilities by complimenting him He responded just as Mr Putin had calculatedMr Putin is a great leader Mr Trump says ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin Mr Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian not American interests — endorsing Russian espionage against the United States supporting Russia’s annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic StatesIn the intelligence business we would say that Mr Putin had recruited Mr Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian FederationMr Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country This position which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religionsIn fact many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country including the man whom I cannot identify who ran the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept  attacksMy training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it This is what I did for the CIA This is what I am doing now Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president,I Ran the CIA Now Im Endorsing Hillary Clinton,Real
Contrary to the conventional wisdom saying that Bernie Sanders would never have been able to force a contested Democratic convention Hillary Clinton has less than  pledged delegates Thus Bernie Sanders has recently confirmed his desire to continue as stated by TimeBernie Sanders Vows to Continue ‘Political Revolution’ in New YorkBut that did not stop the Vermont Senator from defiantly promising to continue the political revolution in a town hall on Thursday giving a glimpse into his possible future role in the Democratic Party in which he campaigns for progressive candidates across the countrySpeaking with the cadence and conviction of a viable candidate in midtown Manhattan Sanders again did not concede the nomination…and did not endorse his opponent Here’s the video of Bernie’s address from last week and there’s also no concession only a reassurance to millions that his campaign is alive and wellTherefore progressive media and pundits should refrain from their gleeful calls to end Bernie’s campaign Vermont’s Senator is taking his political revolution to Philadelphia and he’ll continue to run for the presidencyWhy would he stopWould you end your presidential campaign if your opponent faced on ongoing FBI criminal investigationBernie Sanders his campaign and millions of supporters throughout the nation and world must wait until July  knowing that the FBI will likely disclose its findings of Clinton’s email investigation before the Democratic convention POLITICO confirmed the other day that Clinton’s email investigation is a “criminal investigation” as stated by Federal Judge Emmet SullivanJudge links Clinton aide’s immunity to ‘criminal investigation’A former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation a federal judge confirmed TuesdayBryan Pagliano a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about Clinton’s private server setupHowever there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigation—which Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a “security review”—is actually a criminal probe“The privacy interests at stake are high because the government’s criminal investigation through which Mr Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential” US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued TuesdayWhen a US District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a “criminal” investigation there’s no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency Furthermore Judge Sullivan clearly stated “The privacy interests at stake are high because the government’s criminal investigation through which Mr Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential”Clinton’s “security review” days are over especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigationBut there’s no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences rightIf you know the answer to this question then tell the world next year’s winner of the Super Bowl Also explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top SecretEmails from Hillary Clinton’s home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive US intelligence according to a document obtained by NBC NewsIn a letter to lawmakers the intelligence community’s internal watchdog says some of Clinton’s emails contained information classified Top SecretSpecial Access Program a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held US intelligence mattersTwo American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from Clinton’s server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top Secret…While she was secretary of state from  to  Clinton conducted government business over private email The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server which she kept in her home in Westchester County NYThe act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act I explain why Clinton’s Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segmentFinally nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than Clinton’s treatment of donors As stated by CNN last week Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategyWashington CNN A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in  despite having no clear background in the area according to emails released this week…In July  Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board ISAB a panel filled with toplevel foreign policy advisers and security experts Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel which includes retired generals the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other highranking national security experts…As a member of the toplevel group Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive informationFernando professional State Department staff noted seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in …An aide Wade Boese replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added Fernando’s name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton “The true answer is that S staff Cheryl Mills added him The board’s membership preceded me Raj was not on the list sent to S he was added at their insistence” Boese wrote “S” refers to Clinton ABC News reportedNot only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy but he’s also a Democratic super delegateStill believe the system didn’t favor ClintonFrom private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates Clinton’s candidacy is unique in American history I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations I asked if they could crunch the numbers and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probesSomething tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact Bernie’s challenger risks serious legal consequences One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in Clinton’s position Therefore Bernie has every reason to stay in the race especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probeWith Bernie Sanders there’s no risk of scandal or FBI investigations The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop especially since Clinton’s emails will dominate the media very soon Bernie Sanders just made it official and after the FBI discloses its findings expect Bernie Sanders to become Democratic Nominee The “data driven” analysis on candidates with ongoing FBI criminal investigations says Bernie Sanders is still the frontrunner in ,Its Official Bernie Sanders Is Staying In The Race And Will Not Concede,Real

As a retired military officer I watched last night’s Republican debate from Detroit transcript here with a special focus on which candidate is qualified to lead the military as commanderinchief  I knew of course that Donald Trump had promised in the past to use torture against America’s enemies last night he called them “animals” that he would pursue and kill not only terrorists but their families apparently because the families always know according to Trump what their fatherbrothersister is up to as if there are no secrets in families  Trump in short is an Old Testament “eye for an eye” man if they behead us we’ll torture and kill them end of storyBut Trump was put on the spot when he was asked what he would do if the US military failed to carry out his unlawful orders Instead of saying he wouldn’t issue unlawful orders that he would support and defend the US Constitution which as president would be his sworn duty to uphold Trump boasted that the military would follow his orders no matter whatAmerica those are the words of a dictatorHere’s what was saidBAIER Mr Trump just yesterday almost  foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable General Michael Hayden former CIA director NSA director and other experts have said that when you asked the US military to carry out some of your campaign promises specifically targeting terrorists’ families and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding the military will refuse because they’ve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal ordersSo what would you do as commanderinchief if the US military refused to carry out those ordersTRUMP They won’t refuse They’re not going to refuse me Believe meBAIER But they’re illegalTRUMP Let me just tell you you look at the Middle East They’re chopping off heads They’re chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way They’re drowning people in steel cages And he — now we’re talking about waterboardingThis really started with Ted a question was asked of Ted last — two debates ago about waterboarding And Ted was you know having a hard time with that question to be totally honest with you They then came to me what do you think of waterboarding I said it’s fine And if we want to go stronger I’d go stronger too because franklyAPPLAUSE that’s the way I feel Can you imagine — can you imagine these people these animals over in the Middle East that chop off heads sitting around talking and seeing that we’re having a hard problem with waterboarding We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding That’s my opinionBAIER But targeting terrorists’ familiesAPPLAUSETRUMP And — and — and — I’m a leader I’m a leader I’ve always been a leader I’ve never had any problem leading people If I say do it they’re going to do it That’s what leadership is all aboutOur military does not follow blindly orders issued by “The Leader” Our military swears an oath to the Constitution  We swear to uphold the law of the land  We don’t swear allegiance to a single man or woman as presidentTrump’s performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixon’s infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate “When the president does it that means it’s not illegal” No no a thousand times no  The president has to obey the law of the land just as everyone else has to  No person is above the law an American ideal that Trump seems neither to understand nor to embraceAnd that disqualifies him to be president and commanderinchief,Last Night Donald Trump Disqualified Himself,Real

As the father of three daughters I reserved the right to interview their dates Seemed only fair to me After all my wife and I’d spent  or  years feeding them dressing them funding braces and driving them to volleyball tournaments and piano recitals A fiveminute facetoface with the guy was a fair expectation For the next few hours she would be affected by his ability to drive a car avoid the bad crowds and stay sober I wanted to know if he could do it I wanted to know if he was decentThis was my word “decent” Would he treat my daughter with kindness and respect Could he be trusted to bring her home on time In his language actions and decisions would he be a decent guyDecency mattered to me as a dad and decency matters to Americans We take note of the person who pays their debts We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen When the husband honors his wedding vows when the teacher makes time for the struggling student when the employee refuses to gossip about her coworker when the losing team congratulates the winning team we can characterize their behavior as decentWe appreciate decency We applaud decency We teach decency We seek to develop decencySo why isn’t decency doing better in the presidential raceThe leading Republican candidate to be the next leader of the free world would not pass my decency interview I’d send him away I’d tell my daughter to stay homeI don’t know Mr Trump But I’ve been chagrined at his antics He ridiculed a war hero He made a mockery of a reporter’s menstrual cycle He made fun of a disabled reporter He referred to a former first lady Barbara Bush as “mommy” and belittled Jeb Bush for bringing her on the campaign trail He routinely calls people “stupid” and “dummy” One writer catalogued  occasions that he called someone “loser” These were not offline backstage overheard nottoberepeated comments They were publicly and intentionally tweeted recorded and presentedSuch insensitivities wouldn’t be acceptable even for a middle school student body election But for the Oval Office And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faithI have no inside track on the intricacies of a presidential campaign I’m a pastor I don’t endorse candidates or place bumper stickers on my car But I am protective of the Christian faith If a public personality calls on Christ one day and calls someone a “bimbo” the next is something not awry And to do so not once but repeatedly unrepentantly and unapologetically We stand against bullying in schools Shouldn’t we do the same in presidential politicsCould concerns be raised about other Christian candidates Absolutely But the concern of this article is not policy but tone and decorum Prior presidents have exercised a restraint of the tongue It’s hard to imagine George HW Bush using locker room language to demean an opponent on a debate stage I didn’t vote for President Obama but I appreciate the manner in which he has maintained the comportment of the office At least we don’t wince when he stands to speakWhen it comes to language Mr Trump inhabits a league of his own Some of my friends tell me that his language is a virtue But I respectfully part company with my Christian colleagues who chalk up his abrasive nature to candor “For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks” Jesus said Words are a heart monitor Christians would do well to summon any Christian leader to a higher heart standard This includes pastors especially this one teachers coaches and by all means presidential candidatesAll of themThe stock explanation for Mr Trump’s success is this He has tapped into the anger of the American people As one man said “We are voting with our middle finger” Sounds more like a comment for a gangfight than a presidential election Angerfueled reactions have caused trouble ever since Cain was angry at AbelWe can only hope and pray for a return to verbal decency Perhaps Mr Trump will better manage his comments Worthy of a prayer for sure Or perhaps the American public will remember the key role of the president to be the face of America When he or she speaks he or she speaks for us Whether we agree or disagree with the policies of the president do we not hope that they speak in a way that is consistent with the status of the officeAs far as I remember I never turned away one of my daughter’s dates They weren’t perfect but they were decent fellows That was all I could askIt seems that we should ask the same of these candidates,Max Lucado Trump doesnt pass the decency test,Real

Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald TrumpI call it a “mystery” because the workingclass white people who make up the bulk of Trump’s fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate filling stadiums and airport hangars but their views by and large do not appear in our prestige newspapers On their opinion pages these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind but “bluecollar” is one they persistently overlook The views of workingclass people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to “engage” a Trump supporter last week he made one up along with this imaginary person’s responses to his questionsWhen members of the professional class wish to understand the workingclass Other they traditionally consult experts on the subject And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement they always seem to zero in on one main accusation bigotry Only racism they tell us is capable of powering a movement like Trump’s which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansionsTrump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini This goldplated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance a gorgeous mosaic of haters each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real honesttogod bigot in the White HouseAll this stuff is so insane so wildly outrageous that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign Trump appears to be a racist so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers And so on Saturday New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than “the people” for Trump’s racism “Donald Trump’s supporters know exactly what he stands for hatred of immigrants racial superiority a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society”Stories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day Articles that accuse Trump’s followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds if not the thousands Conservatives have written them liberals have written them impartial professionals have written them The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced bluntly that “Trump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist” A New York Times reporter proved that Trump’s followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches Everyone knows it Trump’s followers’ passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House The Trump movement is a onenote phenomenon a vast surge of racehate Its partisans are not only incomprehensible they are not really worth comprehending  Or so we’re told Last week I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke I was disgusted by these things as I have been disgusted by Trump for  years But I also noticed something surprising In each of the speeches I watched Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue one that could even be called leftwingYes Donald Trump talked about trade In fact to judge by how much time he spent talking about it trade may be his single biggest concern – not white supremacy Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border the issue that first won him political fame He did it again during the debate on  March asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney he chose to pivot and talk about … tradeIt seems to obsess him the destructive freetrade deals our leaders have made the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands the phone calls he will make to those companies’ CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the USTrump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea under his leadership the government would “start competitive bidding in the drug industry” “We don’t competitively bid” he marveled – another true fact a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration Trump extended the critique to the militaryindustrial complex describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyistsThus did he hint at his curious selling proposition because he is personally so wealthy a fact about which he loves to boast Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance famous dealmaker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are “good” instead of “bad” The chance that he will actually do so of course is small He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things But at least Trump is saying this stuffAll this surprised me because for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months I didn’t recall trade coming up very often Trump is supposed to be on a onenote crusade for whiteness Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon  Trade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socioeconomic status To the professional class which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures economists Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers what they call “free trade” is something so obviously good and noble it doesn’t require explanation or inquiry or even thought Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ  dreamTo the remaining  or  of America trade means something very different There’s a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey Mexico and that they’re all going to lose their jobsAs I watched it I thought of all the arguments over trade that we’ve had in this country since the early  all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to MexicoWell here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico courtesy of Nafta This is what it looks like The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to “stay competitive” and “the extremely pricesensitive marketplace” A worker shouts “Fuck you” at the executive The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can “share” his “information” His information about all of them losing their jobs  Now I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist Either he is one or as the comedian John Oliver puts it he is pretending to be one which amounts to the same thingBut there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair with the zones of economic misery that  years of Washington’s freemarket consensus have brought the rest of AmericaIt is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches What this suggests is that he’s telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march Many of Trump’s followers are bigots no doubt but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town unlike Barack Obama and Hillary ClintonHere is the most salient supporting fact when people talk to white workingclass Trump supporters instead of simply imagining what they might say they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it I am referring to a study just published by Working America a politicalaction auxiliary of the AFLCIO which interviewed some  white workingclass voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and JanuarySupport for Donald Trump the group found ran strong among these people even among selfidentified Democrats but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House Their favorite aspect of Trump was his “attitude” the blunt and forthright way he talks As far as issues are concerned “immigration” placed third among the matters such voters care about far behind their number one concern “good jobs  the economy”“People are much more frightened than they are bigoted” is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum the executive director of Working America The survey “confirmed what we heard all the time people are fed up people are hurting they are very distressed about the fact that their kids don’t have a future” and that “there still hasn’t been a recovery from the recession that every family still suffers from it in one way or another”Tom Lewandowski the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about workingclass Trump fans “These people aren’t racist not any more than anybody else is” he says of Trump supporters he knows “When Trump talks about trade we think about the Clinton administration first with Nafta and then with  China and here in Northeast Indiana we hemorrhaged jobs”“They look at that and here’s Trump talking about trade in a hamhanded way but at least he’s representing emotionally We’ve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal and we endorsed some of these people and then we’ve had to fight them to get them to represent us”Now let us stop and smell the perversity Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people But our left party in America – one of our two monopoly parties – chose long ago to turn its back on these people’s concerns making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class a “creative class” that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps The working people that the party used to care about Democrats figured had nowhere else to go in the famous Clintonera expression The party just didn’t need to listen to them any longerWhat Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying then should be obvious to anyone who’s dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts Illconsidered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people ever – these policies have taken their toll As Trump says “we have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart Our infrastructure is falling apart … Our airports are like Third World”Trump’s words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideasYet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence for the frustration of the workingclass millions for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly

Park City Utah CNNMitt Romney suggested Friday that Donald Trumps election could legitimize racism and misogyny ushering in a change in the moral fabric of American societyThe  Republican nominee who has openly opposed Trumps candidacy went further than he has before in outlining to CNNs Wolf Blitzer how the countrys character would suffer in a Trump White House Trumps rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarksI dont want to see trickledown racism Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference I dont want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation and trickledown racism trickledown bigotry trickledown misogyny all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of AmericaRomney retreat puts spotlight on Trumps fundraising problem in critical stretchTrump speaking at a rally in Richmond Virginia Friday night didnt address Romneys criticism directly but did say I am the least racist person the least racist person that youve ever seen a line he frequently says at campaign eventsBy Saturday morning Trump was directly responding to Romney tweeting Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog Now he calls me racistbut I am least racist person there is Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog Now he calls me racistbut I am least racist person there isHe then added Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist He kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa Florida telling the crowd I dont think he knows what a misogynist is Dont forget this guy let us down He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in PittsburghRomney considering JohnsonRomney who actively sought to recruit an independent thirdparty challenger to Trump also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge But he did show a new openness to one nonTrump candidate libertarian Gary Johnson whom he did not rule out voting forJohnsons running mate is another former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld who once fundraised for Romney If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standardbearer Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fallHillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisersIf Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president Romney said So Ill get to know Gary Johnson better and see if hes someone who I could end up voting for Thats something which Ill evaluate over the coming weeks and monthsRomneys comments on The Situation Room are some of the highestprofile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson given his position on marijuana legalizationMarijuana makes people stupid Romney quippedJohnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer lookI think Mitt Romney hit it on the head He said Hey Im going to check out Gary Johnson and see what hes got to say he told CNNs Victor Blackwell on CNN Newsroom I think that kind of scrutiny holds up

ruled out running himself but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger Several soughtafter Republicans including Ben Sasse and author David French have taken passesOrrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad AliI think youre not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a thirdparty contender Romney said The only way to win the White House in my view is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr Trump or about Secretary ClintonTrump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson appearing later on The Situation Room dismissed Romneys criticismThis again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades Pierson saidAnd Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday Respect Mitt and differences but couldnt disagree more SCOTUS too important to lose for generations Lets stop this and unify Respect Mitt and differences but couldnt disagree more SCOTUS too important to lose for generations Lets stop this and unifyIn Richmond Trump alluded to his critics though he didnt mention Romney by nameClinton donor received top spot on State Department intel boardThese poor people going Never Trump never Trump  theyve been doing it for months They did it with Indiana they did it with New York  Were going to win New York  and I won in a massive landslideMy choice is differentRomney again speculated about what might be in Trumps tax returns which he has repeatedly declined to release claiming that hes under audit Asked what might be in there Romney referred to a monthsago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York CityHes calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone but if he released his taxes hed lose support Romney said So theres something in those taxes thats even worse than shooting someone on Fifth AvenueYet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him Romneys mentee and vicepresidential running mate Paul Ryan has uneasily backed Trump but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speakers decisionAre you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him Blitzer askedI wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr Trump and chosen someone else Romney said But my choice is different than that of the other people and Im certainly not going to argue with them about their choiceSanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaigns futureRomney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary For much of the campaign Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternativeI dont think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a frontrunner by the people running against him he said lamenting that they were firing at each other Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over  million And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others as opposed to focusing it on the frontrunnerBut if Romney had ranHad I been in the race he said I can assure you I would have taken him on,Mitt Romney says Donald Trump will change America with trickledown racism,Real

“Why Is Clinton disliked““Why the hate for Hillary““Why do people hate Hillary Clinton so much“Is it because of partisanshipOr a hardfought primaryMaybe NBC once suggested it’s because “she’s not a train wreck”Funny how the answers seem to be everything but the obviousWe go on endlessly about how “untrustworthy” she is while fact checkers rank her as the secondmost honest prominent politician in the country And her opponent as by far the leastWe say that she has trouble with transparency while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecyWe decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose reelection was funded by a recordshattering Wall Street haulWe list so very many explanations all of them complete bullshitIn truth the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her They demand to be humored and catered to They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion Above all they really really want to see her punished And an aggressive male presence—even if dangerously incompetent—seems to comfort a great many of themEveryone but them knows damn well whyBad news for the haters History is decidedly unafraid of “the woman card” It doesn’t care how many people will stand on tables today and swear they’d feel the same if she were a man It will see us for what we are—a sick society driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurtureIf that answer isn’t as nuanced as the average thinkpiece that’s because we as a people are not No matter how many branches have formed they all emerged from the same seed planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor She wouldn’t be so suspicious of the press or so measured in her presentation or so any one of a thousand other things if she had been born a manThe lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen in retrospect as extraordinaryWhen the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by  administration officials through private RNCowned accounts in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys just one talk show covered it that SundayWhen Mitt Romney wiped servers sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent  in taxpayer money to destroy his administration’s emails it was barely an issueWhen Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal recordkeeping lawsI didn’t have a Blackberry What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line sounds ancient So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts I did the same thing on the road in hotels There is a real danger If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it  government and you are using it government or not to do business it may become an official record and subject to the lawYet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didn’t use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign “My God” people cry “anyone else would be in jail”Or is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping  million people in  countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to it—specifically Nobel Peace Prizewinning economist Muhammad Yunus—in her official capacity as Secretary of StateIt should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses fake universities fake charities and now a fake campaign Last week he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds Oh and did we mention that he like so many of his online “supporters” is a goddamn Russian stooge I tried to list all of the dumb awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping upVoters it seems are his easiest marks yetAnd it isn’t just Republicans The double standards are even more transparent on the leftBack in the  Clinton’s persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the centerleft establishment out Michael Moore observed that “ is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do to prove they’re not really liberal” The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy extraordinary sort of policingSince then Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale Her  platform was slightly to Obama’s left on domestic issues Her  platform was barely to the right of selfproclaimed socialist Bernie SandersYet we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her “far right voting record” untrustworthy promises or everchanging policy positions Jon Stewart recently called Clinton “a bright woman without the courage of her convictions because I don’t know what they even are” Because if he doesn’t know she must not have any rightIn fact there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction If you can’t figure out which maybe the problem is youYet many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war now say they couldn’t possibly vote for Clinton because she did tooAnd view her with contempt for opposing samesex marriage in  while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders who held the same position at the same timeIt’s time to stop pretending that this is about substance This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that frankly should never have existed in the first place This is about the one thing no one wants to admit it’s aboutConsider for a moment two people One as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks The other as a young millionaire exacted revenge on his recently deceased brother’s family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephew’s newborn son who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorderWhat kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest officeGenerations from now people will shake their heads at

We live in a big diverse society There are essentially two ways to maintain order and get things done in such a society — politics or some form of dictatorship Either through compromise or brute force Our founding fathers chose politicsPolitics is an activity in which you recognize the simultaneous existence of different groups interests and opinions You try to find some way to balance or reconcile or compromise those interests or at least a majority of them You follow a set of rules enshrined in a constitution or in custom to help you reach these compromises in a way everybody considers legitimateThe downside of politics is that people never really get everything they want It’s messy limited and no issue is ever really settled Politics is a muddled activity in which people have to recognize restraints and settle for less than they want Disappointment is normalBut that’s sort of the beauty of politics too It involves an endless conversation in which we learn about other people and see things from their vantage point and try to balance their needs against our own Plus it’s better than the alternative rule by some authoritarian tyrant who tries to govern by clobbering everyone in his wayAs Bernard Crick wrote in his book “In Defence of Politics” “Politics is a way of ruling divided societies without undue violence”Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics These groups — best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right — want to elect people who have no political experience They want “outsiders” They delegitimize compromise and dealmaking They’re willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decisionmaking if it helps them gain powerUltimately they don’t recognize other people They suffer from a form of political narcissism in which they don’t accept the legitimacy of other interests and opinions They don’t recognize restraints They want total victories for themselves and their doctrineThis antipolitics tendency has had a wretched effect on our democracy It has led to a series of overlapping downward spiralsThe antipolitics people elect legislators who have no political skills or experience That incompetence leads to dysfunctional government which leads to more disgust with government which leads to a demand for even more outsidersThe antipolitics people don’t accept that politics is a limited activity They make soaring promises and raise ridiculous expectations When those expectations are not met voters grow cynical and disgusted turn even further in the direction of antipoliticsThe antipolitics people refuse compromise and so block the legislative process The absence of accomplishment destroys public trust The decline in trust makes dealmaking harderWe’re now at a point where the Senate says it won’t even hold hearings on a presidential Supreme Court nominee in clear defiance of custom and the Constitution We’re now at a point in which politicians live in fear if they try to compromise and legislate We’re now at a point in which normal political conversation has broken down People feel unheard which makes them shout even louder which further destroys conversationAnd in walks Donald Trump People say that Trump is an unconventional candidate and that he represents a break from politics as usual That’s not true Trump is the culmination of the trends we have been seeing for the last  years the desire for outsiders the bashing style of rhetoric that makes conversation impossible the decline of coherent political parties the declining importance of policy the tendency to fight cultural battles and identity wars through political meansTrump represents the path the founders rejected There is a hint of violence undergirding his campaign There is always a whiff and sometimes more than a whiff of “I’d like to punch him in the face”I printed out a Times list of the insults Trump has hurled on Twitter The list took up  pages Trump’s style is bashing and pummeling Everyone who opposes or disagrees with him is an idiot a moron or a loser The implied promise of his campaign is that he will come to Washington and bully his way throughTrump’s supporters aren’t looking for a political process to address their needs They are looking for a superhero As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found the one trait that best predicts whether you’re a Trump supporter is how high you score on tests that measure authoritarianismThis isn’t just an American phenomenon Politics is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide The answer to Trump is politics It’s acknowledging other people exist It’s taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements As Harold Laski put it “We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony”,The Governing Cancer of Our Time,Real
Like any number of us raised in the late  century I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany Watching Donald Trump’s rise I now understand Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate That is not my point My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided countryTo understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism I have generally relied on the GermanJewish émigré philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil Somehow people can understand themselves as “just doing their job” yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called “Men in Dark Times” In this book she described all those who thought that Hitler’s rise was a terrible thing but chose “internal exile” or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation They knew evil was evil but they too facilitated it by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessnessOne can see both of these phenomena unfolding now The first shows itself for instance when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of Trump’s mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing Are they not just doing their jobs they will ask in covering the Republican frontrunner Have we not already been acculturated by  years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments Yes both of these things are true But that doesn’t mean journalists ought to be Trump’s megaphone Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate That will seem counter to journalistic norms yes but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas He’ll still have plenty of access to freedom of expression It is time to draw a bright lineHow Donald Trump won the South Carolina GOP primary in  seconds  Play  Trump won the Feb  South Carolina GOP primary Heres how Peter StevensonThe Washington PostOne spots the second experience in any number of watercooler conversations or dinnerparty dialogues “Yes yes it is terrible Can you believe it Have you seen anything like it Has America come to this” “Agreed agreed” But when someone asks what is to be done silence falls Very many of us too many of us are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usuallyBut over the course of the past few months I’ve learned something else that goes beyond Arendt’s ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of dangerTrump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him Similarly a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable but they too thus far have been unable to coordinate a solution Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological dividesThe only way to stop him then is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties We have reached that moment of truthRepublicans you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination and I intend to vote for her but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses as your party knows quite well The result of a headtohead contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable Trump has to be blocked in your primaryJeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out just as he did the right thing by being the first alongside Rand Paul to challenge Trump The time has come John Kasich and Ben Carson to leave the race as well You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals If you care about the future of this republic it is time to endorse Marco Rubio Kasich there’s a little wind in your sails but it’s not enough Your country is calling you Do the right thingTed Cruz is I believe pulling votes away from Trump and for that reason is useful in the race But Mr Cruz you are drawing too close to Trump’s politics You too should change courseDemocrats your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump but then again she might not Too much is uncertain this year You too need to help the Republicans beat Trump this is no moment for standing by passively If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come reregister and vote for Rubio even if like me you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination The republic cannot afford thatFinally to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out one more great act of public service awaits you As candidates you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated It’s time to revoke your pledge Be bold stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your party’s nominee Do it together Hold one big mother of a news conference Endorse Rubio together It is time to draw a bright line and you are the ones on whom this burden falls No one else can do itMarco Rubio this is also your moment to draw a bright line You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the party’s nominee if it is TrumpDonald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligenceWe the people need to find somewhere buried in the recesses of our fading memories the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties The time is now,The moment of truth We must stop Trump,Real
Some time ago Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state Clinton herself was clearly not really all that remorseful about this and it showed in her early efforts to address it Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret which they hoped would lay the issue to restIt did not Instead emailrelated talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way July polling showed  percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another  percent piling on to say the episode showed “bad judgments” albeit not criminalityBecause Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important Clinton allies surrogates and copartisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fryThis has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong meaning that every bit of micronews that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did In total network newscasts have remarkably dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton’s emails than to all policy issues combinedThis is unfortunate because emailgate like so many Clinton pseudoscandals before it is bullshit The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election — overwhelming stories of much more importance giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous wayWhy Hillary Clinton used a personal email accountWhen Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state she like most people already had a personal email account Like most people who started a federal job in  she was also disheartened to learn that the thencurrent state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts she would need to carry two smartphonesAs any reporter in Washington knows this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit but nobody could really do anything about it Meanwhile Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealerClinton decided to do something about it Namely she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted This violated an internal State Department policy directive known as a Foreign Affairs Manual which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally “normal daytoday operations” should be conducted on standard State Department equipment Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue but it’s hardly a matter of overwhelming public concernAnd indeed it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didn’t use email and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was So at the time Clinton took office only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did — just use your personal email addressWhy Hillary used a private email serverWhen Hillary tried the eminently sensible “I was following precedent” defense Politifact dinged her answer as “mostly false” on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account he didn’t use a private email serverThis distinction has attracted a lot of attention And it’s proven politically damaging — because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service But legally speaking this is completely irrelevant As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on Clinton’s conduct the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that “normal daytoday operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System”Using a private server violates that rule but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your Stategov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Departmentissue oneBut while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant it’s certainly unusual And it leaves people wondering Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private serverClinton as you may have heard is married to former president Bill Clinton who stepped down from office in January of  Clinton was in the White House throughout the  when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CDROMs so he didn’t have a personal email when he left Gmail didn’t exist back then and his new job was in effect running a Bill Clinton startup He launched a charitable foundation he established his presidential library and he made big bucks on speaking tours He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could useHillary Clinton — who is again his wife — also set herself up with an account on the same server This is a bit unusual but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual What it’s not is suspiciousThe private server was not a transparency dodgeIt’s become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officials’ constant FOIAdodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information ActMany people for example point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument But this is silly I’ve been known to travel with an iPhone an iPad a Kindle and a laptop all at once That doesn’t mean needing to carry two separate iPhones one to check my work email and one to check my personal email wouldn’t be inconvenient After all what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check itI’d be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the doublefisting phones eraI would not want to do that Colin Powell did not want to do that Hillary Clinton did not want to do that Because that would be terribleBy contrast it’s a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA One way you can tell it’s a terrible solution is that Hillary Clinton’s work emails have been disclosed to the public You can read them right hereThe specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested Clinton’s emails in the summer of  at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address State asked Clinton for the emails and she handed them over later that year It was only in March of  that the New York Times broke the story of Clinton’s personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt the server was reported a few days later by the AP which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department “two months ago”This is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government recordkeeping as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the timeIt’s a shame it didn’t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassmentAccording to the Inspector General’s report Clinton “should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary”There are two possible interpretations here One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal recordkeeping laws but then months before the public became aware of the server’s existence complied with requests to turn them over The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason and simply got ignored out of sloppinessBut she deleted  emailsSuspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than  emails from her serverAfter Hillary left office the State Department told her she had to turn all her workrelated emails over to them so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not She turned the work emails over because that’s what she was legally required to do She deleted the others presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalistsNow is it possible that Clinton’s legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete workrelated emailsIn some sense sure But there’s no evidence that this happened Generally speaking in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a wellknown law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squealBesides which it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails The vast majority of the workrelated email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state after all is going to be correspondence with other government employees Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team Any message like that by definition would exist on a government server as well as on her private one This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if Clinton’s copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over she’d be caught red handedThe available FOIA workarounds are available to everyoneNow what’s true is that Clinton could in theory have conducted workrelated email conversations using another person’s personal email addressShe could for instance have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server We’d be in the dark and she’d get away with itThe key thing to note here however is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with Clinton’s decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private serverAt any given time any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over But in a practical sense if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it And as Ezra Klein has noted there are a lot of workarounds hereAs every reporter knows when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate they email you from a personal account — or much more often they callA lot of my reporting happens by email But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email There emails for clarification or comment quickly lead to phone calls The reason — unsaid but obvious — is that phone calls dont leave an official record White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they cant over emailSimilarly the White House keeps a visitors log If you make an appointment to meet with someone your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online When someone who shouldnt be meeting with you wants to meet with you they tend to suggest an offsite location a restaurant downtown or a nearby coffee shop Peets Coffee doesnt keep a list of everyone who walks in or outWe do not however generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the lawBesides which when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence classificationHere for example is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June   that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office I’m not saying the contents of that message don’t deserve to be redacted for security purposes The fact is that I have no idea But the reality is the American national security state is really really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information Nobody needs a private email server to pull that offIndeed the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous On the one hand a private server would not be necessary to carry it out All you need is to have a private email address on the side which everyone does While on the other hand the exclusive use of a personal email account means that Clinton’s personal account has come under an exceptional level of securityThe classification thing is a red herringIt’s precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified informationThe key point here is that using a Stategov email account would not have changed anything When US government officials have conversations about classified matters they are not supposed to use email They are supposed to use special secure channelsNonetheless mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and everchanging Technically speaking forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified mattersAs FBI Director James Comey concluded “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case against Clinton over this matter Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution a standard that Clinton’s conduct clearly does not meet Critics have thus chosen to focus on  USC §  a statute that sets a lower “gross negligence” standardHowever as Jack Goldsmith one of the top lawyers in George W Bush’s administration explains such a prosecution “would be entirely novel and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind”Ben Wittes a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law wrote that Comey’s characterization was clearly correctFor the last several months people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind People simply dont get indicted for accidental nonmalicious mishandling of classified material I have followed leak cases for a very long time both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information Hillary Clinton is not above the law but to indict her on these facts shed have to be significantly below the lawIt’s true that to a layman the Espionage Act’s reference to “gross negligence” sounds similar to Comey’s characterization of Clinton’s actions as “extremely careless” But as Philip Zelikow a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains they only sound alike “unless you do a tiny bit of homework” on the history and caselaw of the StatuteDid Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails Philip Zelikow walks you through  AnnCompton pastpunditry — Miller Center MillerCenter November   the Cato Institute’s Julian Sanchez writes attempting a prosecution for nonmalicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional “the Supreme Court’s opinion in Gorin v United States  which suggests that the Espionage Act’s intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness”This legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails aren’t simply clientside copies of the exact emails the FBI already has there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict The reason Clinton isn’t getting locked up is that there was no malign intent Finding another email with classified information on it won’t change that conclusionA bullshit scandal amidst a serious electionNetwork newscasts have remarkably dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton’s emails than to all policy issues combinedCable news has been if anything worse and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase ‘‘Clinton email scandal’’ have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husband’s computerBut none of this is true Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable fits the facts perfectly and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesnt simply start with the assumption that shes guilty of somethingGiven Powell’s conduct Clinton wasnt even breaking with an informal precedent The very worst you can say is that faced with an annoying government IT policy she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race much less a presidential election To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself,The real Clinton email scandal is that a bullshit story has dominated the campaign,Real
The American media over the past year has been trying to work out something of a mystery Why is the Republican electorate supporting a farright orangetoned populist with no real political experience who espouses extreme and often bizarre views How has Donald Trump seemingly out of nowhere suddenly become so popularWhats made Trumps rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines — education income age even religiosity — that usually demarcate candidates And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucusesTable of contentsI What is American authoritarianismII The discoveryIII How authoritarianism worksIV What can authoritarianism explainV The party of authoritariansVI Trump authoritarians and fearVII Americas changing social landscape VIII What authoritarians want IX How authoritarians will change American politics Perhaps strangest of all it wasnt just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere suddenly expressing in large numbers ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory In South Carolina a CBS News exit poll found that  percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldnt have freed the slavesLast September a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteriesMacWilliams studies authoritarianism — not actual dictators but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders People who score high in authoritarianism when they feel threatened look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fearSo MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for TrumpHe polled a large sample of likely voters looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism What he found was astonishing Not only did authoritarianism correlate but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina shortly before the primary there and found the same results which he published in Vox  As it turns out MacWilliams wasnt the only one to have this realization Miles away in an office at Vanderbilt University a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment He realized that he and a fellow political scientist the University of North Carolinas Jonathan Weiler had essentially predicted Trumps rise back in  when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realizedThat year Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis they had come to a surprising conclusion Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oftcited variables but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group — authoritariansTheir book concluded that the GOP by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendenciesThis trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration which activated authoritarian tendencies leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alienTrump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style simple powerful and punitiveThese Americans with authoritarian views they found were sorting into the GOP driving polarization But they were also creating a divide within the party at first latent between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and often more extremeOver time Hetherington and Weiler had predicted that sorting would become more and more pronounced And so it was all but inevitable that eventually authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heardAt the time even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications that their theory when followed to its natural conclusion predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics But looking back now the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clearAuthoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things And the extreme nature of authoritarians fears and of their desire to challenge threats with force would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics — and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable normsA candidate like Donald Trump Donald TrumpScott OlsonGetty ImagesEven Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been In the early fall of  as Trumps rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists he called Weiler He asked over and over Can you believe this Can you believe thisThis winter I got in touch with Hetherington MacWilliams and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted with such eerie accuracy Trumps rise And like them I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics Was Trump just the start of something biggerThese political scientists were at that moment beginning to grapple with the same question We agreed there was something important happening here — that was just beginning to be understoodDonald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politicsShortly after the Iowa Republican caucus in which Trump came in a close second Vox partnered with the Washingtonbased media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views — and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the fieldWhat we found is a phenomenon that explains with remarkable clarity the rise of Donald Trump — but that is also much larger than him shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade Trump it turns out is just the symptom The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this electionI What is American authoritarianism A Trump supporter carries a sign saying Build the wallAndrew RenneisenGetty ImagesFor years now before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question part political science and part psychology that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the NazisHow do people come to adopt in such large numbers and so rapidly extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leaderTo answer that question these theorists study what they call authoritarianism not the dictators themselves but rather the psychological profile of people who under the right conditions will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement themThe political phenomenon we identify as rightwing populism seems to line up with almost astonishing precision with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressedAfter an early period of junk science in the  century a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question specifically studying how it plays out in American politics researchers like Hetherington and Weiler Stanley Feldman Karen Stenner and Elizabeth Suhay to name just a fewThe field after a breakthrough in the early  has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism culminating quite recently in  with Stenners seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic — just in time for that theory to seemingly come true more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined in the personage of one Donald Trump and his normshattering riseAccording to Stenners theory there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies These tendencies can be triggered or activated by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarianIt is as if the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written a button is pushed that says In case of moral threat lock down the borders kick out those who are different and punish those who are morally deviantAuthoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump — and will persist as a force in American politicsAuthoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world Challenges to that order — diversity influx of outsiders breakdown of the old order — are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic securityThis is after all a time of social change in America The country is becoming more diverse which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before Those changes have been happening for a long time but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed workingclass white peopleWhen they face physical threats or threats to the status quo authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears They favor forceful decisive action against things they perceive as threats And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this actionIf you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters the result would look a lot like Donald TrumpBut political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump placing him within larger trends in American politics polarization the rightward shift of the Republican Party and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politicsMore than that authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics And it suggest that a combination of demographic economic and political forces by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP — a phenomenon that broke into public view with the  election but will persist long after it has endedII The discovery how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics Buttons for sale on the day of the  Iowa caucusesBrendan HoffmanGetty ImagesButtons for sale on the day of the  Iowa caucusesThis study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideologyThat was a worthy field of study but the early work wasnt particularly rigorous by todays standards The critical theorist Theodor Adorno for instance developed what he called the Fscale which sought to measure fascist tendencies The test wasnt accurate Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the right answers were and game the test And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascismMore than that this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous — an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong and that they resist in their work They acknowledge the label authoritarians doesnt do much to dispel this but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorativesounding term were unsuccessfulIf this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trumps ascent then how else might it be shaping American politicsBut the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile how do you measure it How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies which can sometimes be latent How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicizedAs Hetherington explained to me There are certain things that you just cant ask people directly You cant ask people Do you not like black people You cant ask people if theyre bigotsFor a long time no one had a solution for this and the field of study languishedThen in the early  a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything Feldman a professor at SUNY Stonybrook believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferencesHe realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable parenting goalsFeldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy order and conformity over other valuesPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have independence or respect for eldersPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have obedience or selfreliancePlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have to be considerate or to be wellbehavedPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have curiosity or good mannersFeldmans test proved to be very reliable There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile by prizing order and conformity for example and desiring the imposition of those valuesIn  Feldman convinced the National Election Study a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year to include his four authoritarianism questions Ever since political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferencesWhat they found was impossible to ignore — and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorateIII How authoritarianism works A Tea Party supporter holds a sign asking Obama wheres your papersJustin SullivanGetty ImagesA  protest against President ObamaIn the early  as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump but seemingly a halfcentury of American political dynamicsThe first was Hetherington and Weilers insight into partisan polarization In the  the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law order and traditional values — a position that naturally appealed to order and traditionfocused authoritarians Over the decades that followed authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP where their concentration gave them more and more influence over timeThe second was Stenners theory of activation In an influential  book called The Authoritarian Dynamic Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent — that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been activatedThe social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change such as Muslims or samesex couples or Hispanic migrants but rather to reject all of themThis activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect In response previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call TrumpesqueOther researchers like Hetherington take a slightly different view They believe that authoritarians arent activated — theyve always held their authoritarian preferences — but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsidersBut both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threatsThe third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay who found that when nonauthoritarians feel sufficiently scared they also start to behave politically like authoritariansBut Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism which could lead nonauthoritarians to behave like authoritarians and more abstract social threats such as eroding social norms or demographic changes which do not have that effect That distinction would turn out to be important but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidlyTogether those three insights added up to one terrifying theory that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary in their view to meet the rising threatsThis theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged seemingly out of nowhere to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the  GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in  being almost alarmingly prescient this theory speaks to an oftstated concern about Trump that whats scariest is not the candidate but rather the extent and fervor of his supportAnd it raises a question If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trumps ascent then how else might it be shaping American politics And what effect could it have even after the  race has endedIV What can authoritarianism explain Trump greets supporters in AlabamaMark WallheiserGetty ImagesIn early February shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support I began talking to Feldman Hetherington and MacWilliams to try to answer these questionsMacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life from policy positions to party politics to social issues and what it might mean for Americas futureIt was time to call Kyle Dropp Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as the Doogie Howser of polling He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor But he is also the cofounder of a media and polling company Morning Consult that had worked with Vox on several other projectsWhen we approached Morning Consult Dropp and his colleagues were excited Dropp was familiar with Hetheringtons work and the authoritarianism measure he said and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election Hetherington and the other political scientists were in turn eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevantNonauthoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritariansWe put together five sets of questions The first set of course was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didnt with our other sets of questionsThe second set asked standard electionseason questions on preferred candidates and party affiliationThe third set tested voters fears of a series of physical threats ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidentsThe fourth set tested policy preferences in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policiesIf the research were right then wed expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of outsider threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats We also expected that nonauthoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge which would in turn lead to Trump supportWe wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the electionThe final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change We asked people to rate a series of social changes — both actual and hypothetical — on a scale of very good to very bad for the country These included samesex marriage a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States and American Muslims building more mosques in US citiesIf the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the countryIn the aggregate we were hoping to do a few things We wanted to understand who these people are in simple demographic terms and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism in theory is supposed to work We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election Were they driving certain policy positions for exampleWe wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme — was it migration terrorism perhaps the decline of workingclass whites And maybe most of all we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally dividedAbout  days later shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary the poll went into the field In less than two weeks we had our resultsV How the GOP became the party of authoritarians Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in TexasTom PenningtonGetty ImagesDonald Trump and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in TexasThe first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are Our results found that  percent of white respondents nationwide scored as high or very high authoritarians with  percent as very high Thats actually not unusual and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from  key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent people in this  percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat physical or social But that latency is part of how over the past few decades authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing itToday according to our survey authoritarians skew heavily Republican More than  percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters More than  percent of surveyed Republicans scored as high or very high authoritariansAnd at the other end of the scale that pattern reversed People whose scores were most nonauthoritarian — meaning they always chose the nonauthoritarian parenting answer — were almost  percent DemocratsBut this hasnt always been the case According to Hetherington and Weilers research this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus Its a story of polarization that increased over timeThey trace the trend to the  when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms — for example the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights The GOP also embraced a law and order platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riotsThis positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures — a role that it has maintained ever since That promise to stave off social change and if necessary to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinationsDemocrats by contrast have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights equality and social progress — in other words as the party of social change a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels changeaverse authoritariansOver the next several decades Hetherington explained to me this led authoritarians to naturally sort themselves into the Republican PartyThat matters because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP they have more influence over its policies and candidates It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarianPerhaps more importantly the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians voting preferences — even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishmentVI Trump authoritarians and fear  Based on our data Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that among Republicans very highhigh authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump Trump has  percent support among Republicans but according to our survey a full  percent support among very high authoritariansAuthoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump although having a high school education also came close And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust even after controlling for education level and genderTrump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism only  percentBut thats still awfully high So what could explain Trumps support among nonauthoritariansI suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhays research on how fear affects nonauthoritarian voters so I called them to discuss the data Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two thingsThe first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threatsAuthoritarians we found in our survey tend to most fear threats that come from abroad such as ISIS or Russia or Iran These are threats the researchers point out to which people can put a face a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah Nonauthoritarians were much less afraid of those threats For instance  percent of very highscoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a very high risk to them but only  percent of very lowscoring authoritarians did Domestic threats like car accidents by contrast were much less frightening to authoritariansBut Hetherington also noticed something else A subgroup of nonauthoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS And the more fear of these threats they expressed the more likely they were to support Trump  This seemed to confirm his and Suhays theory that nonauthoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritariansThats important because for years now Republican politicians and Republicanleaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isnt doing enough to keep Americans safeThere are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens But the point is that as a result Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers As the perception of physical threat has risen this fear appears to have led a number of nonauthoritarians to vote like authoritarians — to support TrumpAn irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by among other things coopting his message But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trumps rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to TrumpVII Is Americas changing social landscape activating authoritarianismBut the research on authoritarianism suggests its not just physical threats driving all this There should be another kind of threat — larger slower less obvious but potentially even more powerful — pushing authoritarians to these extremes the threat of social changeThis could come in the form of evolving social norms such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation It could come in the form of rising diversity whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV Or it could be any changes political or economic that disrupt social hierarchiesWhat these changes have in common is that to authoritarians they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it — familiar orderly secure — and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society According to the literature authoritarians will seek in response a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes if necessary by force and to preserve the status quoThis is why in our survey we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus nonauthoritarians expressed a fear of social change — and whether this as expected led them to desire heavyhanded responses  Our results seemed to confirm this Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as bad or very bad for the countryFor instance our results suggested that an astonishing  percent of authoritarians believe samesex marriage is harmful to the country Twentyeight percent rated samesex marriage as very bad for America and another  percent said that it’s bad Only about  percent of highscoring authoritarians said samesex marriage was good or very good for the countryTellingly nonauthoritarians responses skewed in the opposite direction Nonauthoritarians tended to rate samesex marriage as good or very good for the countryThe fact that authoritarians and nonauthoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as samesex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rightsWe also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing This was intended to test respondents comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims — an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election  A whopping  percent of very highscoring authoritarians said it was either bad or very bad for the country when Muslims built more mosques Only  percent of that group said more mosques would be good or very goodThe literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as outsiders and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communitiesThis would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change such as Muslims or samesex couples or Hispanic migrants but rather to reject all of them What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselvesAnd America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly when several social changes are converging And they are converging especially on workingclass white peopleIt is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that workingclass white Americans are angryIndeed they are but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that according to this research are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism — and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple anger that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responsesWorkingclass communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades owing to migration and other factors The president is a black man and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concernsSome of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others — the loss of workingclass jobs in this country is a real and important issue no matter how one feels about fading white privilege — but that is not the pointThe point rather is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as rightwing populism or white workingclass populism seems to line up with almost astonishing precision with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressedThat is not to dismiss white workingclass concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics but rather to better understand why this is happening — and why its having such a profound and extreme effect on American politicsHave we misunderstood hardline social conservatism all alongMost of the other socialthreat questions followed a similar  On its surface this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hardline manifestations of social conservatism But when examined more carefully it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itselfFor liberals it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like samesex marriage immigration and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups — that its the manifestation of specific homophobia xenophobia and IslamophobiaBut the results of the VoxMorning Consult poll along with prior research on authoritarianism suggests there might be something else going onThere is no particular reason after all why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups We werent asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally So why do they coincide so heavilyWhat might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenners theory of activationWhat is most likely Hetherington suggested is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific other — whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threateningIt all depends he said on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not — whether they had been identified as a dangerous otherSince September  some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America Authoritarians by nature are more susceptible to these messages and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communitiesWhen told to fear a particular outgroup Hetherington said On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like I’m not that worried about that while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like Oh my god I’m worried about that because the world is a dangerous placeIn other words what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenners theory of activation that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given momentThats not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia — it is still dangerous and damaging especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald TrumpPerhaps more to the point it helps explain how Trumps supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups mass deportation of millions of people a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries this starts to make a lot more senseVIII What authoritarians wantFrom our parenting questions we learned who the GOP authoritarians are From our questions about threats and social change we learned whats motivating them But the final set of questions on policy preferences might be the most important of all So what What do authoritarians actually wantThe responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences distinct from GOP orthodoxy And those preferences mean that in real and important ways authoritarians are their own distinct constituency effectively a new political party within the GOPWhat stands out from the results Feldman wrote after reviewing our data is that authoritarians are most willing to want to use force to crack down on immigration and limit civil libertiesThis action side of authoritarianism he believed was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats — that is most clear among Trump supportersAuthoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically we found were highly likely to support five policiesUsing military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United StatesChanging the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrantsImposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorismRequiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request to curb terrorismAllowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorismWhat these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats physical and social and more than that a desire to meet those threats with severe government action — with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality The scale of the desired response is in some ways what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOPMany Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism violence and cultural diversity but thats not unique to Trump supporters Feldman told meIt seems to be the action side of authoritarianism — the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats — that is most clear among Trump supporters he addedIf Trump loses the election that wont remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianismThis helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time coopting Trumps supporters even though those supporters immediate policy concerns such as limiting immigration or protecting national security line up with party orthodoxy The real divide is over how far to go in responding And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policiesJust as striking is what was missing from authoritarians concerns There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than  per year for example And the same was true of support for international trade agreementsThese are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies All groups opposed the tax cuts and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism So there is no real divide on these issuesBut there is one more factor that our data couldnt capture but is nevertheless important Trumps styleTrumps specific policies arent the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates Rather its his rhetoric and style The way he reduces everything to blackandwhite extremes of strong versus weak greatest versus worst His simple direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manageAnd perhaps most importantly his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening Thats why its a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pigbloodtainted bullets He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he wont let political correctness hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fearThis Feldman explained to me is classic authoritarian leadership style simple powerful and punitiveIX How authoritarians will change the GOP — and American politics Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz confront Trump during the February  GOP debateMichael CiagloPoolGetty ImagesTo my surprise the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasnt about Trump at allRather it was that authoritarians as a growing presence in the GOP are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump — and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacyIf Trump loses the election that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianism The authoritarians will still be there They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong punitive leadership they desireAnd that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics with potentially profound implications for the countryIt would also mean more problems for the GOP This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for — his showy demagoguery his disregard for core conservative economic values his divisivenessWe may now have a de facto threeparty system the Democrats the GOP establishment and the GOP authoritariansBut while the party may try to match Trumps authoritarian rhetoric and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump canThat will be a problem for the party Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in  but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaoticNow a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP and thus able to force their will within the party but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their ownAnd so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto threeparty system the Democrats the GOP establishment and the GOP authoritariansAnd although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishments centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platformOver time this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policiesAnd in the meantime the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger Norms around gender sexuality and race will continue evolving Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the countrys legacy of institutionalized discrimination pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threateningThe chaos in the Middle East which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries shows no sign of improving Longer term if current demographic trends continue white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decadesIn the long run this could mean a GOP that is even more hardline on immigration and on policing that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning and perhaps eventually unable to win the White HouseFor decades the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well — and threatens to tear the party apart,The rise of American authoritarianism,Real
On Monday Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester New Hampshire where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy Twentyfour hours later Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslideIm not here to clutch my pearls over Trumps vulgarity what was telling rather was the immaturity of the moment the glee Trump took in his she said it I didnt game The media which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow delighted in the moment along with him — it was funny and it meant clicks takes traffic But it was more than that It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogues instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mobIt is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump Hes redfaced discursive funny angry strange unpredictable and real He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id Americas most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show weve ever seenIts so fun to watch that its easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really isTrump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament hes a racist a sexist and a demagogue but hes also a narcissist a bully and a dilettante He lies so constantly and so fluently that its hard to know if he even realizes hes lying He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlashDonald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary DayPhoto by Joe RaedleGetty ImagesTrump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination His triumph in a general election is unlikely but it is far from impossible Hes not a joke and hes not a clown Hes a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations This is not political entertainment This is politicsTrumps path to power has been unnerving His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period He responded to rival Ted Cruzs surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because Donald Trump was right all these illegals need to be deported he brushed off complaints that hes inspiring violence by saying his supporters are very passionateBehind Trumps success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger resentment and fear His view of the economy is entirely zerosum — for Americans to win others must lose Were going to make America great again he said in his New Hampshire victory speech but were going to do it the oldfashioned way Were going to beat China Japan beat Mexico at trade Were going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis Its not going to happen anymoreTrump answers Americas rage with more rage As the journalist Molly Ball observed All the other candidates say Americans are angry and I understand Trump says I’M angry Trump doesnt offer solutions so much as he offers villains His message isnt so much that hell help you as hell hurt themDonald Trump Holds New Hampshire Primary Night Gathering In ManchesterPhoto by Joe RaedleGetty ImagesTrumps other gift — the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important — is his complete lack of shame Its easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery Most people feel shame when theyre exposed as liars when theyre seen as uninformed when their behavior is thought cruel when respected figures in their party condemn their actions when experts dismiss their proposals when they are mocked and booed and protestedTrump doesnt He has the reality television stars ability to operate entirely without shame and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint It is the single scariest facet of his personality It is the one that allows him to go where others wont to say what others cant to do what others wouldntTrump lives by the reality television trope that hes not here to make friends But the reason reality television villains always say theyre not there to make friends is because it sets them apart makes them unpredictable and fun to watch Im not here to make friends is another way of saying Im not bound by the social conventions of normal people The rest of us are here to make friends and it makes us boring gentle kindThis more than his ideology is why Trump genuinely scares me There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump his temperament is so immature his narcissism so clear his political base so unique his reactions so strange that I honestly have no idea what he would do — or what he wouldnt doWhen MSNBCs Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin who kills journalists political opponents and invades countries Trump replied Hes running his country and at least hes a leader unlike what we have in this country Later he clarified that he doesnt actually condone killing journalists but he warned the crowd I do hate themIts a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil but its a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating itBut tonight is a night to repeat it There is something scary in Donald Trump We should fear his rise,The rise of Donald Trump is a terrifying moment in American politics,Real
There is a smug style in American liberalism It has been growing these past decades It is a way of conducting politics predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence — not really — but by the failure of half the country to know whats good for themIn  the smug style has found expression in media and in policy in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the worldIt has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect a condescending defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus dressed up as a monopoly on reasonThe smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demographyBeginning in the middle of the  century the working class once the core of the coalition began abandoning the Democratic Party In  in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt  percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats along with  percent of farmers In  it was  percent of workingclass voters By  it was  percentThe white working class in particular saw even sharper declines Despite historic advantages with both poor and middleclass white voters by  Democrats possessed only a  advantage among poor white voters Among white voters making between  and  per year the GOP has taken a  leadFinding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful hapless rubes smug liberals created a culture animated by that contemptThe consequence was a shift in liberalisms intellectual center of gravity A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves Minority voters remained but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decisionmaking they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core the educated the coastal and the professionalIt is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them When the laborer left they remainedThe origins of this shift are overdetermined Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame but so does Bill Clinton The Southern Strategy yes but the destruction of labor unions too I have my own sympathies but I do not propose to adjudicate that question hereSuffice it to say by the  the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle What happened to our coalitionWhy did they abandon usWhats the matter with KansasThe smug style arose to answer these questions It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable the theory that conservatism and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country was not a political ideology at allLearn more  How politics makes us stupidThe trouble is that stupid hicks dont know whats good for them Theyre getting conned by rightwingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies thatve made them so wrong They dont know any better Thats why theyre voting against their own selfinterestAs anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance You lose somebody You blame them Soon the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance the excuse to drive them even further awayFinding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful hapless rubes smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt The result is a selffulfilling prophecyFinancial incentive compounded this tendency — there is money after all in reassuring the bitter Over  years an industry arose to cater to the smug style It began in humor and culminated for a time in The Daily Show a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were before anything else stupid The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing themThe internet only made it worse Today a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanationStudy finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox NewsTheyre beating CNN watchers tooNPR listeners are best informed of all He likes thatYoure better off watching nothing than watching Fox He likes that even moreThe good news doesnt stopLiberals arent just better informed Theyre smarterTheyve got better grammar They know more wordsSmart kids grow up to be liberals while conservatives reason like drunksLiberals are better able to process new information theyre less biased like that Theyve got different brains Better ones Why Evolution Theyve got better brains topnotch amygdalae science findsThe smug style created a feedback loop If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance then the liberal impulse was to correct it When such corrections failed disdain followed after itOf course there is a smug style in every political movement elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to societys ills But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them or make so tenuous its case against its enemiesConservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October because people en masse arent very bright or sophisticated and theyre vulnerable to cheap hysterical emotional appealsThe smug style thinks Williamson is wrong of course but not in principle Its only that hes confused about who the hordes of stupid hysterical people are voting for The smug style reads Williamson and says No YouElites real elites might recognize one another by their superior knowledge The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowingKnowing for example that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists Knowing that youre actually like  times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own selfinterest and that the trouble is Kansas doesnt know any better Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledgeThe studies about Daily Show viewers and bettersized amygdalae are knowing It is the smug styles first premise a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts A politics that insists it has no ideology at all only facts No moral convictions only charts the kind that keep them from imposing their morals like the bad guys doKnowing is the shibboleth into the smug styles culture a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste that loves nothing more than hatereading anyone who doesnt get them A culture that has come to replace politics itselfThe knowing know that police reform that abortion rights that labor unions are important but go no further What is important after all is to signal that you know these things What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who dont The Good Facts are enough Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem is terminally uncool No persuasion only retweets Eye roll crying emoji forward to John Oliver for sick burnsThe smug style has always existed in American liberalism but it wasnt always so totalizing Lionel Trilling claimed as far back as  that liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition that the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse  do not express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideasThe smug style has always existed in American liberalism but it wasnt always so totalizingRichard Hofstadter the historian whose most famous work The Paranoid Style in American Politics this essay exists in some obvious reference to advanced a similar line in writing not so wellremembered today His theninfluential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history who have failed to maintain correct political attitudesBut  years ago American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold Even its elitists its Schlesingers and Bells were tempered by the power of the labor movement by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics — forces too powerful to allow nonelite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon Walter Reuther and Bayard Rustin and A Philip Randolph were still in the room and they matteredSixty years ago the ugliest tendencies were still private too The smug style belonged to real elites knowing in their cocktail parties far from the ears of rubes But today we have television and the internet and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks Today the better part of liberalism is Trillings — or those whod like to be at any rate — and everyone can hear themOn June   the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to samesex couples constituted a violation of the  Amendment After decades of protests legislation setbacks and litigation the  states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent Kim Davis a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county refusedAt the distance of six months it is surprising that she was beyond a few shortlived and empty efforts the only civil bureaucrat to do so One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country small administrators with small power outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years priorIn the days between the June decision and the July  announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerks office many braced for resistance Surely compliance would come hard in some places Surely some of the losers would refuse to give up There was something giddy about it — at long last the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the lawIt did not take long for the law to correct Davis On August  a judge ordered a stay preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law The Sixth Circuit and then the Supreme Court refused to hear her appealDespite further protest and Daviss ultimate jailing for contempt of court normal service was restored in short order The  people of Rowan Country suffered all told slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatusDavis remained a fixation Dour rural thrice divorced but born again — Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks — that she had been married so many times was inexplicable That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution doubly soWhen Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foeThe ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles always on the precipice of selfreproach began eventually to rein in the excess Mocking her appearance openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent — these were not good looks  Kim Davis at a rally in September  Ty WrightGetty ImagesBut a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged the contention at bottom that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions but that her convictions were in themselves an error and a fraudThat is Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture Rather she was a subscriber to nothing a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religionChristianity as many hastened to point out is about love Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesars If the Bible took any position on the issue at all it was that divorce beloved by Davis was a sin and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithfulHow many of these critiques were issued by atheistsThis more than anything I can recall in recent American life is an example of the smug style Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life many believe moreover that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong even harmful to society But to the smug liberal it isnt that Kim Davis is wrong How can she be Shes only mistaken She just doesnt know the Good Facts even about her own religion Shes angry and confused another hick whos not with itIt was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots But this is knowing knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just dont get their own faithKim Davis was behind the times Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all They were incoherent at odds with the Good Facts Google makes every man a theologianThis I think is fundamental to understanding the smug style If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets — that is if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world — then there are no moral fights only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe themWhen Davis was first released from county jail Mike Huckabee went to meet her But the smug style sees no true ideology there no moral threat to contend with Only a huckster and a hick one to be ridiculed and the other to be refuted What more the smug man posts could there be to say about it Theyre idiots Look look This Onion article nails itPopular storyAdlai Stevenson Democratic candidate for president is on parade A band is playing Onlookers cheer He waves to the crowdA woman shouts Gov Stevenson you have the vote of every thinking person in this countryStevenson replies Thank you maam but we need a majorityThe smug style says to itself Yeah I really am one of the few thinking people in this country arent IIn November of last year during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called Dumb Hicks Are Americas Greatest ThreatIf there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style to the proposition that it is neither malice nor capital nor ideological difference but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy then it is hidden beyond our view in some uncool place far from the front page of GawkerLearn more  Why have weddings and houses gotten so ridiculously expensive Blame inequalityMany of Americas political leaders are warning of the dangers posed by Syrian refugees They are underestimating though the much greater danger dumbass hicks in charge of things Nolan wrote You our elected officials are embarrassing us All of us except your fellow dumb hicks who voted for you in large numbers You — our racist xenophobic knuckledragging ignorant leaders — are making us look bad in front of the guests the whole world You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone pleaseAmong the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are many Southern mayors and many lesser known state representatives He cites the Ku Klux Klan — exclusively dumbass hicks he writes  he emphasizes — despite the fact that the New York Times in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfrontorg found that the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading That they are news and political junkies Despite the fact that if you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimescomThey have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid the Times reportsIn another piece published later the same month Nolan wrote that Inequality of wealth — or if you like the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty — is not just one issue among many It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problemsHes right about that But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality The poor The dumb The hicksHamilton Nolan isnt stupid He has even lately argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle Yet the trouble is still swallowing what motherfuckers those people areNolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the dumbass hicks but he isnt alone It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn too That they buy the same smartphones That they too are on Twitter That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too That theyre better at it and always will beNo The trouble must be out there somewhere In the country Where the idiots are where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossomTo the dumb hick leaders of America I say nothing You wouldnt listen anyhow Nolan writes My words would go in one ear and right out the other Like talking to an old block of woodIts a shame They might be receptive to his concerns about povertyIf there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination it is former President George W Bush Hes got the accent He cant talk right He seems stupefied by simple concepts and his politics are all geewhiz Texas ignorance He is the urhick He is the enemyHe got all the way to White House and hes still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him — just like those poor rubes in Kansas If only George knew Dick Cheney wasnt acting in his own best interestsIt is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and YaleIt is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor mindsIt is worth considering that beginning with his  gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards and at every juncture thereafter opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a oneonone debateThroughout his short political career ABCs Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the  debates against Al Gore Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign lifeDone little to contradict  George W Bush and Al Gore during a presidential debate in  Tannen MauryAFPGetty ImagesOn November   during his final preelection stump speech Bush explained his history of political triumph thusly They misunderesimated meWhat an idiot American liberals made fun of him for that one for yearsIt is worth considering that he didnt misspeakHe did however deliberately cultivate the confusion He understood the smug style He wagered that many liberals eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficitsHe wagered correctly Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected too stupid to get reelected too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight Liberals misunderestimated George W Bush all eight years of his presidencyGeorge W Bush is not a dumbass hick In eight years all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agendaThe smug mind defends itself against these charges Oh were just having fun it says We dont mean it This is just for a laugh its just a joke stop being so humorlessIt is exasperating after all to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much they say You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing but we are right on the issues arent we We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution and samesex marriage and climate change too Surely thats what mattersWe dont really mean theyre all stupid — but hey lay off Were not smug This is just how we vent our frustration Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these peopleWe have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not for instance the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus The Daily Show as it happens is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam It is broadcast on national televisionTwitter isnt private Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be Otherwise how would everyone know how intheknow you areThe rubes have seen your videos You posted it on their wallStill dont get why liberal opinion is correct This video settles the debate for goodI have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the oped pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced beforeWe have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress reliefIts an accepted nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the US have a problem — that their youth tend toward violent ideology or are susceptible to radicalization by groups like the Islamic State began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times But after all it goes on the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communitiesBut this contention — that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies — has been challenged countless times hasnt it It was challenged here and here and here as far back as  The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published The Times itself did too The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a fiveyearold Onion headline not some new moral challengeThe smug style leaves its adherents no other option If an idea has failed to take hold if the Good Facts are not widely accepted then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelieversIn December  Public Policy Polling found that  percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah the Arabsounding fictional city from Disneys Aladdin HilariousPPP has run joke questions before of course polling the popularity of Deez Nuts or asking after Gods job approval But these questions at least let their audience in on the gag Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it This is not a survey in service of a joke — it is a survey in service of a human punchlineAs if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a goodfaith question by guessing from their general principlesIt may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites but the rubes can read the New York Times too It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a jokeLearn more  Latebreaking sexism why younger women aren’t excited about electing a woman presidentThis is the consequence of private venting and it is the consequence of knowing too If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them — that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasionNo it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged — that their believers are trapped in information bubbles and confirmation bias That no one knows the truth except the New York Times or Vox If only we could tell them question them show them this graph If they dont get it then well then theyre hopelessThe smug style plays out in private too of course If you havent started one yourself youve surely seen the Facebook threads Ten or  of Brooklyns finest gather to say how exasperated they are these days by the stupidity of the American publicI just dont know what to do about these people one posts I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed replies another Like I think they actually dont want to know anything that would undermine their worldviewThey tend to do it in the comment section under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubblesWhat have been the consequences of the smug styleIt has become a tradition for the smug in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate in command of the facts wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponentIt was popularly assumed for a time that George W Bush was too stupid to be elected presidentThe smug believed the same of Ronald ReaganJohn Yoo the architect of the Bush administrations torture policies escaped The Daily Show unscathed Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails What would success look like Were police waiting in the wings a oneway ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed himIt would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes But the lesson has been We underestimated how many people could be fooledThat is We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really areWe just didnt get our message to them They just stayed in their information bubble We cant let the lying liars keep lying to these people — but how do we reach these idiots who only trust FoxRarely Maybe theyre savvier than we thought Maybe theyre angry for a reasonAs it happens reasons arent too difficult to come byDuring a San Francisco fundraiser in the  primary campaign Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from thenSenator CoolYou go into these small towns in Pennsylvania Obama said and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest the jobs have been gone now for  years and nothings replaced them And they fell through the Clinton administration and the Bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not And its not surprising then they get bitter They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or antiimmigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrationsIts the latter part that we remember eight years later — the clinging to guns and religion and hate — but it is the first part that was important the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrationsObamas observation was not novelThe notion that material loss and abandonment have driven Americas white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Partys tepid left these days But in the presidents formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes the downturn the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed are a force of nature — something that has been happening in the passive voiceIf the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence its Why are they voting against their own selfinterestThis I suspect will one day become the Republican Partys rationale for addressing climate change Look we dont know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room But shes here now thats undeniable so weve gotta get rid of the bodyToday it is the excuse of American smug mind Where did all of these poor people come fromIf pressed for an answer I suppose they would say Republicans elected by rubes voting against their own selfinterest Reagan Gingrich Bush — all those Bad Fact–knowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anythingWell sure In the past  years of American life the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagans faceBut this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities abandoning the dispossessed to their fate It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding We didnt abandon them The idiots didnt want to be savedIt was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based culturally liberal industries of technology Hollywood and high finance were the future of the American economyIf the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence its Why are they voting against their own selfinterest But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them tooAbandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests people cling to candidates who at the very least are willing to represent their moral convictions The smug style resents them for it and they resent the smug in turnThe rubes noticed that liberal Democrats distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples threatened boycotts against the state mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov Mike Pence but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined  others in refusing the Medicaid expansion No doubt good liberals objected to that move too But Ive yet to see a boycott threat about itEarly in the marriage equality fight activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay they became far more likely to support gay rights They were correct These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power — whether in business or government or media — to avoid having openly gay colleagues colleagues whom they like and whom theyd like to helpBut few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road much less those scraping by in IndianaIf any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay it was a running argument I had with an older liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trumps presidential campaign Since June  when Trump announced his candidacy this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dudeThat saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers tooRidicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies he told me in the end but especially against the ones who not incorrectly take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detestIf youre laughing at someone youre certainly not respecting himAnyway he went on Im done talking to you We see the world differently Im fine with that We dont need to be friendsRidicule is the most effective political tacticRidicule is especially effective when its personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid bad peoplePolitical legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberalsYou cant be legitimate if youre the butt of our jokesIf you dont agree we cant work together politicallyWe cant even be friends because politics is socialBecause politics is performative — if we dont mock together we arent on the same sideIf there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere then cross off every square Youve wonI would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism If I believed that its politics as practiced by its supporters extended beyond this line of thought If this were an exceptionBut even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his partys nomination the smug interpretation has been predictable We only underestimated how hateful how stupid the Republican base can be  A Donald Trump rally in Pittsburgh Jeff SwensenGetty ImagesTrump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style if anything it will redouble it Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton the smug will reach a fever pitch six straight months of a sure thing an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask How could anybody vote for this guy until a morning in November when they ask What the fuck happenedOn March  Salons David Masciotra wrote that if Trump actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths he would turn his favorite word — loser — not on fulltime professionals in the press but on his supportersMasciotra goes onJournalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant there are large numbers of white high school dropouts and unemployed people no longer looking for work An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trumps candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma and withdrawal from the labor force The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homesThe kicker Many conservatives and even some kindhearted liberals might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping but the empirical evidence leaves little choice Donald Trumps supporters confirm the stereotype against themHeres the conclusion I draw If Donald Trump has a chance in November it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse they will comfort with own impotence by shouting Idiots again and again angrier and angrier the handmaidens of their own destructionThe smug style resists empathy for the unknowing It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with in spite of these differences toward a common goalIt is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House a serious threat a threat to be mocked and called out and hated but not to be taken seriously The wages of smug is TrumpNothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal openmindedness and intellect and knowledge there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualitiesMost damning perhaps to the fancy liberal selfconception Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion They are willing to change their minds more oftenThe Republican coalition tends toward the center educated enough smart enough informed enoughThe Democratic coalition in the  century is bifurcated It has the postgraduates but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees The math proceeds from thereThe smug style takes this as a defense Elite liberalism and the Democratic Party by extension cannot hate poor people they say We arent smug Just look at our coalition These arent rubes Just look at our embrace of their issuesBut observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug another kind of knowing Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct FactsEveryone in the know has read The Case for Reparations but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted praised in the same breath as It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying of coursePretend for a moment that all of it is true That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is that knowing — or knowing no inflection — did make our political divide That the problem is the rubes That the dumbass hicks are to blame They cant help it Their brains dont work They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts and theyre being taken for a ride by con menPretend the ridicule worked too that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go awayWhat kind of world would it leave us An endless cycle of jokes Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing Relative to whom The smug style demands an object of disdain it would find a new one quicklyIt is central to the liberal selfconception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people a desire to create a fairer and more just world Liberals still want or believe they still want to make a more perfect unionWhether you believe they are deluded or not whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itselfIt is impossible in the long run to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best to never hear much less ignore protest to the contraryAt present many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism and are despised in turn Is it surprising that with each decade the help on offer drifts even further from the help these people needIt is impossible in the long run to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect themEven if the two could be separated would it be worth it What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating forThe smug style at bottom is a failure of empathy Further It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate immediately to the Good FactsIf they dont and they wont youre free to write them off and mock them When they suffer its their just dessertsMake no mistake I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy gentler version of their politics I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentionsI am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people tooI am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foeI am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but ones values to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid hypocritical hick without bothering even to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokesThis is not a call for civility Manners are not enough The smug style did not arise by accident and it cannot be abolished with a little selfreproach So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class they will search for reasons to justify that failure They will resent them They will find over and over how easy it is to justify abandoning them further  They will choose the smug styleMaybe the cycle is too deeply set already Perhaps the divide the disdain the whole crackup are

The Republican Party’s attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic If only he would mouth the party’s “conservative” principles all would be wellBut of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology It has nothing to do with the Republican Party either except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy Trump has transcended the party that produced him His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers Their allegiance is to him and him aloneAnd the source of allegiance We’re supposed to believe that Trump’s support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation Maybe some of it does But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies — his proposals change daily What he offers is an attitude an aura of crude strength and machismo a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims and his followers believe has produced national weakness and incompetence His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain intermingled with bits of fear hatred and anger His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others” — Muslims Hispanics women Chinese Mexicans Europeans Arabs immigrants refugees — whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision His program such as it is consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion He will deport them bar them get them to knuckle under make them pay up or make them shut upThat this toughguy getmadandgeteven approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him and something far more dangerousRepublican politicians marvel at how he has “tapped into” a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic the popular passions unleashed the “mobocracy” Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about that the people in a democracy excited angry and unconstrained might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold he feared in America what he saw play out in France — that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant riding to power on the shoulders of the peopleThis phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasidemocratic countries over the past century and it has generally been called “fascism” Fascist movements too had no coherent ideology no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society “National socialism” was a bundle of contradictions united chiefly by what and who it opposed fascism in Italy was antiliberal antidemocratic antiMarxist anticapitalist and anticlerical Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman the leader Il Duce Der Führer in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation Whatever the problem he could fix it Whatever the threat internal or external he could vanquish it and it was unnecessary for him to explain how Today there is Putinism which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who singlehandedly defends his people against all threats foreign and domesticTo understand how such movements take over a democracy one only has to watch the Republican Party today These movements play on all the fears vanities ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche In democracies at least for politicians the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want — vox populi vox Dei A mass political movement is thus a powerful and to those who would oppose it frightening weapon When controlled and directed by a single leader it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses If someone criticizes or opposes the leader it doesn’t matter how popular or admired that person has been He might be a famous war hero but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism the followers laugh and jeer He might be the highestranking elected guardian of the party’s most cherished principles But if he hesitates to support the leader he faces political deathIn such an environment every political figure confronts a stark choice Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories — and democratic politicians are the most predictable There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon They praise the leader’s incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order There are those who merely hope to survive Their consciences won’t let them curry favor so shamelessly so they mumble their pledges of support like the victims in Stalin’s show trials perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anywayRNC chairman Republicans will find common ground with Trump  Play  National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the GOP will find common ground ahead of the general election ReutersA great number will simply kid themselves refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot Let the storm pass they insist and then we can pick up the pieces rebuild and get back to normal Meanwhile don’t alienate the leader’s mass following After all they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold As for Trump himself let’s shape him advise him steer him in the right direction and not incidentally save our political skinsWhat these people do not or will not see is that once in power Trump will owe them and their party nothing He will have ridden to power despite the party catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him By then that following will have grown dramatically Today less than  percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump But if he wins the election his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation Imagine the power he would wield then In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command the Justice Department the FBI the intelligence services the military Who would dare to oppose him then Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak And is a man like Trump with infinitely greater power in his hands likely to become more humble more judicious more generous less vengeful than he is today than he has been his whole life Does vast power uncorruptThis is how fascism comes to America not with jackboots and salutes although there have been salutes and a whiff of violence but with a television huckster a phony billionaire a textbook egomaniac “tapping into” popular resentments and insecurities and with an entire national political party — out of ambition or blind party loyalty or simply out of fear — falling into line behind him,This is how fascism comes to America,Real
It’s impossible to miss the “Hillary for Prison” signs at Trump rallies At one of the Democratic debates the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server “Oh for goodness – that is not going to happen” she said “I’m not even going to answer that question”Based on what I know about the emails the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical Nonetheless the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive A recent New York TimesCBS poll found that  of Democrats say she cannot be trustedFor decades she’s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots branded as “a congenital liar” and accused of covering up her husband’s misconduct from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky Some of this is sexist caricature Some is stoked by the “Hillary is a liar” videos that flood Facebook feeds Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or “zone of privacy” that she protects too fiercely It’s a natural impulse given the level of scrutiny she’s attracted more than any male politician I can think ofI would be “dead rich” to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase if I could bill for all the hours I’ve spent covering just about every “scandal” that has enveloped the Clintons As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings her fundraising her foundation and her marriage As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland That makes what I want to say next surprisingHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthyThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politician’s honesty are pretty simple Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics I’ve looked for connections between money including campaign donations loans Super Pac funds speaking fees foundation ties and official actions I’m on the lookout for lies scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an electionThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy Many investigative articles about Clinton end up “raising serious questions” about “potential” conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment Of course she should be held accountable It was bad judgment as she has said to use a private email server It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees but not corrupt There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactorAs for her statements on issues Politifact a Pulitzer prizewinning factchecking organization gives Clinton the best truthtelling record of any of the  presidential candidates She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump who has the biggest “pants on fire” rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as  can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold As first lady she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy Instead by not disclosing information she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House All Too Human ABC’s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regretThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else The speeches are probably anodyne politicians always praise their hosts so why not release themColin Diersing a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics thinks a genderrelated double standard gets applied to Clinton “We expect purity from women candidates” he said When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions “it’s seen as dishonest” he adds CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing’s point when he asked Clinton “Have you always told the truth” She gave an honest response “I’ve always tried to always Always” Pelley said she was leaving “wiggle room” What politician wouldn’tClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered In her view journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in  Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke She glared down at us launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons’ private life The distrust continuesThese are not new thoughts but they are fundamental to understanding her Tough as she can seem she doesn’t have rhino hide and during her husband’s first term in the White House according to Her Way a critical and excellent investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badlyLike most politicians she’s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth In debates with Sanders she cites her tough record on Wall Street but her Senate bills like one curbing executive pay went nowhere She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income But according to an article by Gerth she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in  that would have closed it She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage Her earlier opposition to gay marriage which she later endorsed has hurt her with young people Labor worries about her different statements on trade dealsStill Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonestIt’s fair to expect more transparency But it’s a double standard to insist on her purity,This may shock you Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest,Real
The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposalsDonald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone especially the wealthy while cutting a wide host of government programs Meanwhile Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite tax increases on everyone with hikes on the wealthy especially while adding comprehensive government programs And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases all focused on the richBut what do their plans mean for your federal tax liabilityWe partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidates tax plan would affect you — or more accurately people like you For example if you are part of a couple with two children earning  a year this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between  and  a yearBefore you change your vacation plans based on these numbers keep in mind they are only estimates Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation — someone might be deducting business expenses for example while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage This creates millions of different scenariosAccounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and timeconsuming But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors income marital status and children and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact individual and corporate income taxes payroll taxes and excise taxesTry it yourself belowNote The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasichs tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do soThe calculator How much does each candidates tax plan affect youRead this Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates On Cruz and Trump he writesIn a sense both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator Theyve proposed tremendous cuts but without knowing who will pay for those cuts its hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurtOn Sanders he writesSanders meanwhile proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them But its wrong I think to view Sanderss plan as primarily a change to Americas tax code The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanderss plans to nationalize major sectors of American lifeRead the full analysis hereUpdate on why rates are higher than you think Weve been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high Heres a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happeningYou might be surprised at how much taxes you’re paying under current law We’re including payroll taxes excise taxes and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax And they pay much more if you include the employer’s portion of the tax Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wagesUpdate plus a FAQ section To calculate the tax rate we originally used adjusted gross income AGI but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income ECI because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax like health insurance premiums paid by employers This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate For a longer explanation read this QAWhat we learned from our calculatorPlay around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor middle class and wealthyIn short what youll see isClinton proposes keeping things mostly the sameSanders wants to implement massive increases across the board including on the poorCruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone — but the wealthier you are the more you keep in your pocketBut how does this affect how much money the federal government brings inIts one thing to know how your taxes will change but you cant view it in a vacuum What the federal government does can affect your bottom line tooFor example Bernie Sanderss plan would raise taxes on everyone but it would also pay for health care education and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for And it goes the other way too If Donald Trumps tax plan was implemented everyone would get a tax cut but it also means government services would be cut so you would have to pay for them yourselfSo this is how each candidate deals with this balanceDonald Trump His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated  trillion over the next decade Cuts would be across the board but most cuts would be for wealthier households His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government Here are more details on Trumps planTed Cruz His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated  trillion over the next decade Much like Trumps plan cuts would be across the board but most cuts are for wealthier households His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government Here are more details on Cruzs planHillary Clinton Her plan would raise federal revenues by an additional  trillion over the next decade Most increases would be for wealthier households while lowerincome households arent affected much The additional revenues will pay for programs that benefit many Americans Here are more details on Clintons planBernie Sanders His plan would raise federal revenues by an estimated  trillion over the next decade He would raise taxes for almost all households but most increases would be for wealthier households tax increases would be small for lower and middleincome households Additional revenues would pay for health care education and other programs so households would pay less than what they currently pay for those services Here are more details on Sanderss plan,This simple calculator tells you how each presidential candidates tax plan affects you,Real

In the heat of a presidential campaign you’d think that a story about one party’s nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominee’s scam “university” would be enormous news But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam BondiI raised this issue last week but it’s worth an update as well as some contextualization The story reemerged last week when The Post’s David A Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondi’s PAC While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight the basic facts are that Bondi’s office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State Bondi called Trump and asked him for a  donation shortly after getting the check Bondi’s office dropped the inquiryAt this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent Perhaps Bondi didn’t realize her office was looking into Trump University Perhaps the fact that Trump’s foundation made the contribution which to repeat is illegal was just a mixup Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account he didn’t realize that’s not how the law works the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondi’s PAC he could then make a personal donation if he wanted Perhaps Bondi’s decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable But here’s the thing We don’t know the answers to those questions because almost nobody seems to be pursuing themFor instance there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on “Face the Nation“ Christie took great umbrage “I can’t believe John that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way” And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clinton’s emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories you see blanket coverage — every cable network every network news program every newspaper investigates it at length And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just “raises questions” about her integrityThe big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on even if there isn’t any evidence at a particular moment to support that ideaWhen it comes to Trump on the other hand we’ve seen a very different pattern Here’s what happens A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists it gets discussed for a couple of days and then it disappears Someone might mention it now and again but the news organizations don’t assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get writtenThe end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clinton’s affairs people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core It’s not that there isn’t plenty of negative coverage of Trump because of course there is but it’s focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given dayBut the truth is that you’d have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption doubledealing and fraud that Donald Trump has The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering Here’s a partial listTrump’s casino bankruptcies which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their moneyTrump’s habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him many of whom are struggling small businessesTrump University which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashedThe Trump Institute another getrichquick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their moneyThe Trump Network a multilevel marketing venture aka pyramid scheme that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitaminsTrump Model Management which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the US illegally and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they didTrump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts which involves a claim that he can’t find Americans to do the workTrump’s use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the  who were paid a pittance for their illegal workTrump’s history of being charged with housing discriminationTrump’s connections to mafia figures involved in New York constructionThe time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission  over charges that he violated antitrust laws when trying to take over a rival casino companyThe fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment According to the allegations Ailes’s behavior was positively monstrous as just one indicator his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so wellknown and so loathsome that in  the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon electedAnd that last one is happening right now To repeat the point is not that these stories have never been covered because they have The point is that they get covered briefly then everyone in the media moves on If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them those reporters would start asking questions and we’d learn more about all of themThat’s important because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in Trump is supposedly the crazybigoted one and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursueAnd it means that to a great extent for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him Trump is still being let off the hook,Trumps history of corruption is mindboggling So why is Clinton supposedly the corrupt one,Real

I don’t know about you but I’m getting tired of  presidential election media coverage It’s been a mess since the beginning when Donald Trump kicked off his campaign with the statement that Mexicans are rapists and major news channels and newspapers responded by giving him just what he wanted more coverage than any other candidateFor months I maintained the position that if we all stopped clicking on Donald Trump headlines he would go away But no one was interested in that strategy and now it’s too late to implement it The media played a major role in Donald Trump’s rise to power and now it seems as though they are rooting for him to maintain itTwo weeks ago a woman filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump alleging that he raped her in  when she was  years old Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Jeffrey Epstein a man who has already served a year in prison for soliciting an underage prostitute and who was recently described by Donald Trump as a “terrific guy”This story was first reported on June  by The Real Deal a publication dedicated to covering New York real estate news It was picked up by Gothamist The Daily Beast Snopes and a few other websites I did not learn about the case until a friend of mine shared this Huffington Post blog about it The case was not covered in Huffington Post’s news section nor in the news section of any major publicationMeanwhile I received two New York Times push notifications this week with updates about Hillary Clinton’s emailsHas the media decided Donald Trump is just so despicable that it isn’t worth covering another atrocity allegedly perpetrated by him while Hillary Clinton is expected to be a perfect human being so more coverage of her emails serves the public good Have they decided Donald Trump is just so immune to negative coverage that reporting this lawsuit is a waste of time while another story on Hillary’s email server is guaranteed to make her even more unpopularOr is giving credence to rape accusations against powerful men still socially unacceptable Re Peyton ManningIt’s difficult for me not to think that sexism has a hand in guiding the media’s wacky priority list I know a lot of people are getting tired of accusations of sexism in this presidential race but sexism would explain why a female candidate sending emails from a private server faces a thousand times more public scrutiny than a male candidate allegedly raping a childTo reiterate what has already been determined about Hillary’s emails Federal law did not prohibit public officials from using private email accounts until  after she left office and none of her emails were considered classified at the time she sent them via a private server And yet Hillary is branded a criminal while Donald Trump—who has now had three legal claims of sexual assault filed against him—remains the successful businessman whose greatest offense is his ego You can counter that the claims of sexual assault against Donald Trump are unproven in a court of law and to that I will counter that Hillary has not been convicted of any crimes either In this country the principle of “innocent until proven guilty” tends to serve the privileged That principle goes out the window when we discuss accusations against women and people of colorDonald Trump may be a megalomaniac who has no experience in public office and has shocked the entire world by making it this far in the race but the absurdity of his candidacy does not mean that he should be vetted less critically than his opponent He may be a racist and a misogynist from whom we can never expect anything but the worst but the reality is that he’s one election away from being the most powerful person on the planet If we dismiss his transgressions as just being typical of his character we may allow him to actually hold that power in his handsTo all the media gatekeepers out there If you are frustrated by the fact that criticisms of Donald Trump do not dissuade his supporters in the slightest I sympathize with you But your frustration is not an excuse for failing to deliver those criticisms which Trump deserves Perhaps this latest development would have no effect on Trump’s poll numbers but it still needs to be covered This is information that the public needs to know,Why Do We Hear More About Hillarys Emails Than Donald Trumps Rape Allegations,
When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president  months ago he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican “rapists” flooding across the Southern borderFrom that moment of combustion it became clear that Mr Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations personal insults xenophobic nationalism unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whimsNow here stands Mr Trump feisty from his runaway Republican primary victories and ready for the first presidential debate scheduled for Monday night with Hillary Clinton It is time for others who are still undecided and perhaps hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance to take a hard look and see Mr Trump for who he is They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician Otherwise they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nation’s wellbeingHere’s how Mr Trump is selling himself and why he can’t be believedDon Levi September   went through the history of the endorsements over the last  from NYT Except for Bill Clinton who was a moderate The TimesDivorce is Good For American Economy September   evidence is here that the Establishment is really really desperateEvidently enough of ordinary Americans are ready what their BritishLiberty Apples September   Donald Trump Should Not Be PresidentI assume this is Part OneSEE ALL COMMENTSDespite his towering properties Mr Trump has a record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures like Trump University which authorities are investigating after numerous complaints of fraud His name has been chiseled off his failed casinos in Atlantic CityMr Trump’s brazen refusal to disclose his tax returns — as Mrs Clinton and other nominees for decades have done — should sharpen voter wariness of his business and charitable operations Disclosure would undoubtedly raise numerous red flags the public record already indicates that in at least some years he made full use of available loopholes and paid no taxesMr Trump has been opaque about his questionable global investments in Russia and elsewhere which could present conflicts of interest as president particularly if his business interests are left in the hands of his children as he intends Investigations have found selfdealing He notably tapped  in donors’ money from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his forprofit businesses according to The Washington PostA straight talker who tells it like it isMr Trump who has no experience in national security declares that he has a plan to soundly defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria but won’t reveal it bobbing and weaving about whether he would commit ground troops Voters cannot judge whether he has any idea what he’s talking about without an outline of his plan yet Mr Trump ludicrously insists he must not tip off the enemyAnother of his cornerstone proposals — his campaign pledge of a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim newcomers plus the deportation of  million undocumented immigrants across a border wall paid for by Mexico — has been subjected to endless qualifications as he zigs and zags in pursuit of middleground votersWhatever his gyrations Mr Trump always does make clear where his heart lies — with the antiimmigrant nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base,Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President,
An anonymous “Jane Doe” filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week accusing him of raping her in  when she was thirteen years old The mainstream media ignored the filingIf the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims And now history is repeating itselfIn covering a story a media outlet is not finding guilt It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr Trump and ideally putting the complaint in context Unproven allegations are just that  unproven and should be identified that way Mr Trump’s lawyer says the charges are “categorically untrue completely fabricated and politically motivated” Proof comes later at trial But the November election will come well before any trial And while Mr Trump is presumed innocent we are permitted — no we are obligated — to analyze the case’s viability nowNo outsider can say whether Mr Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges But we can look at his record analyze the court filings here and make a determination as to credibility — whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they developI have done that And the answer is a clear “yes” These allegations are credible They ought not be ignored Mainstream media I’m looking at  Consider the context Mr Trump’s overt even proud misogynyThe rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr Trump’s current longstanding and well documented contempt for women Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crimeMr Trump has relished calling women “dogs” “slobs” and “pigs” and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words He threw out the most misogynist of attacks attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating He’s cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent Carly Fiorina and an opponent’s wife Heidi Cruz His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vicepresidentMr Trump has a long history of debasing women he’s worked with crossing the line on a regular basis He’s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women including his proclamation “Women you have to treat ‘em like shit”This cannot be ignored Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist But it does show us who the man is a callous meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter As Dr Maya Angelou said “When someone shows you who they really are believe them” More context two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr TrumpBut Mr Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language Two prior women have accused Mr Trump in court documents of actual or attempted sexual assault Mr Trump denies all the allegationsUnder oath Ivana Trump accused Mr Trump of a violent rapeFirst was Ivana Trump Donald Trump’s first wife who said under oath in a  deposition that he had violently attacked her ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent According to the Daily Beast she claims he was wildly angry that she’d referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a “scalp reduction” job to cover a bald spot and caused pain in his scalp  hence the vindictive yanking on her hair At the time Ms Trump said she felt “violated” by the alleged “rape”A few years later after their divorce was settled Ms Trump claimed that she did not mean the word “rape” in a “literal or criminal” senseNote virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse  or anyone  requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality In plain English you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years Ms Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr Trump And it is also common to attempt to “cure” prior negative statements with new agreedto language  like I didn’t mean it literally You didn’t mean forcible penetration literallyA business acquaintance accused Mr Trump of sexual harassment and “attempted rape”A second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault in  According to The Guardian then  Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her “physical and mental integrity” when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him leaving her “emotionally devastated  distraught” The lawsuit called the multiple acts “attempted rape” Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr Trump brought by her husband was settled When The Guardian reached the woman in  to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations she responded “yes”In a court filing according to a report Ms Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr Trump regarding a beauty pageant he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her culminating in this frightening alleged incidentTrump forcefully removed Harth from public areas of MarALago in Florida and forced her into a bedroom belonging to defendant’s daughter Ivanka wherein Trump forcibly kissed fondled and restrained her from leaving against her will and despite her protests” In the court document she said that Trump bragged that he ”would be the best lover you ever have”Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that women’s claims of sexual harassment documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms Harth’s lawsuit were “made up”Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week “My part was true I didn’t talk As usual you opened your big mouth” In other words she is standing by her  The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein and has a powerful witness statement attached to itA third woman accused Mr Trump of rape very recently According to the Daily Mail a woman filed an April  lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein The woman claimed to have a witness “Tiffany Doe” to the incidents She filed the case in pro per that is without the assistance of a lawyerThe case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court against Mr Trump and Mr EpsteinI’ve carefully reviewed this federal complaint It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her Jane Doe says that as a  she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs Mr Epstein is a notorious “billionaire pedophile” who is now a Level  registered sex offender — the most dangerous kind “a threat to public safety” — after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girlJane Doe says that Mr Trump “initiated sexual contact” with her on four occasions in  Since she was thirteen at the time consent is not an issue If Mr Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in  it was a crimeOn the fourth incident she says Mr Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her in a “savage sexual attack” while she pleaded with him to stop She says Mr Trump violently struck her in the face She says that afterward if she ever revealed what he had done Mr Trump threatened that she and her family would be “physically harmed if not killed” She says she has been in fear of him ever sinceNew York’s five year statute of limitations on this claim — the legal deadline for filing — has long since run However Jane Doe’s attorney Thomas Meagher argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr Trump she has been under duress all this time and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward Legally this is calling “tolling” — stopping the clock allowing more time to file the case As a result the complaint alleges Jane Doe did not have “freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time” He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tollingTwo unusual documents are attached to Jane Doe’s complaints — sworn declarations attesting to the facts The first is from Jane Doe herself telling her horrific story including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence and this stunnerDefendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he Defendant Epstein should have been the one who took my virginity not Defendant Trump   And this oneDefendant Trump stated that I shouldn’t ever say anything if I didn’t want to disappear like Maria a  female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident and that he was capable of having my whole family killedThe second declaration is even more astonishing because it is signed by “Tiffany Doe” Mr Epstein’s “party planner” from  Tiffany Doe says that her duties were “to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties” Adolescents are legally childrenTiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York persuaded her to attend Mr Epstein’s parties and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane DoeI personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J Trump and Mr Epstein Both Mr Trump and Mr Epstein were advised that she was  years oldIt is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness But Tiffany Doe saysI personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr Trump during this period including the fourth of these encounters where Mr Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stopTiffany Doe corroborates based on her own personal observations just about everything in Jane Doe’s complaint that  Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr Trump that Mr Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened and that she would “disappear” like Maria if she didTiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr Trump to this dayI am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr Trump and Mr Epstein    I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave dangerGiven all this and based on the record thus far Jane Doe’s claims appear credible Mr Epstein’s own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented as is Mr Trump’s relationship with him two decades ago in New York City Mr Trump told a reporter a few years ago “I’ve known Jeff for  years Terrific guy He’s a lot of fun to be with It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side No doubt about it Jeffrey enjoys his social life”Powerfully Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward because at a minimum Mr Epstein knows her true identityJane Doe has not granted any interviews and we don’t know anything about her background or Tiffany Doe’s or the details of their stories Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case Perhaps they will be discredited on crossexamination Perhaps they will recant But if we’re going to speculate in that direction we should speculate in the other direction as well Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim Perhaps witnesses from Mr Epstein’s notorious parties will come forward We just can’t know any of that at this pointBut based on what we do know now Jane Doe’s claims fall squarely into the long ugly context of Mr Trump’s life of misogyny are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims are backed up by an eyewitness and thus should be taken seriously Her claims merit sober consideration and investigationWe live in a world where wealthy powerful men often use and abuse women and girls While these allegations may shock some as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day I can tell you that sadly they are common as is an accuser’s desire to remain anonymous and her terror in coming forwardWhat do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free worldRape cultureWe ignore the voices of women at our peril,Why The New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be Ignored,

A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public“I’ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people’s business”He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts because he just doesn’t care anymore Recent months aside everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrorsMany are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution It is in his best interest to do so His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of “confidential” “secret” and “top secret” by commenting that “there’s classified and then there’s classified” were not successful He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do soA reporter with firsthand knowledge sums up Obama’s “transparent” government “Obama and his team criminalized reporting becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon”A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency“My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency public participation and collaboration Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government”Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated He knew as did his advisors and supporters that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obama’s campaigns He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until  was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it After leaving the Obama administration Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surfaceSome of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truthObama lied about his support FOR samesex marriage before announcing his support for it in  “Yet if Obama’s views were ‘evolving’ publicly they were fully evolved behind closed doors” Axelrod writes “The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wedObama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the  campaign “No one got under Barack’s skin more than Maureen … He was patronizing and disrespectful” This is a direct contradiction to the calm composed Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray He even lashed out at Axelrod“Obama can have a short fuse though he hides it from the public The president called Axelrod a “mother—–r” and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the president’s debating techniques as Obama prepared for his  debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney” says AxelrodWhile those incidents speak to Obama’s twofaced behavior some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply liesLie Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White HouseTruth In September  an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Iran’s nuclear installationsLie In May  Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was “basically complete”Truth The Department of Homeland Security admits just  miles or  of the border is fencedLie Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under ObamacareTruth A March  edict from the Department of Health and Human Services HHS unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortionBen Rhodes was Obama’s partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration the Iran nuclear treaty Rhodes Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser openly admitted his contempt for journalists “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus Now they don’t They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington The average reporter we talk to is  years old and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns That’s a sea change They literally know nothing”He later admitted more to David Samuels a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story “In the spring of last year legions of armscontrol experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media and then became key sources for hundreds of oftenclueless reporters We created an echo chamber They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say” Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contemptFast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen In  Risen published “State of War The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration” Unsurprisingly President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowersRisen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources something he vehemently refused to do He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories “Well they have gone after investigative reporting They try to take essentially stories that they don’t like and try to find some classified information that might be part of that and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information As you know you could do that with virtually any story in Washington”Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration In  Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in  speech he told reporters “Here in the United States of America police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground”In  despite Risen keeping his sources confidential the federal government indicted Jeffrey A Sterling a former CIA operative with leaking the classified information to Risen He continued his defiance facing jail time when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of SterlingFinally in January of  after  years of uncertainty the government decided not to call Risen in the trial His fight for the truth had finally wonRisen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obama’s years in the White House The truth would be a refreshing changeA supporter of Risen Jerry Kammer a former Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies has this to say about President Obama“He promised to be a different kind of president But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the

Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today With the US led coalition Britain and France included recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the US wound Erdogan’s bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality“They  give support to terrorist groups including Daesh ISISIL We have confirmed evidence with pictures photos and videos”While no videos or pictures have been made public yet the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidenceAdding to the disclosure was Iran’s Defense Minister Hossein DehghanThe Western coalition is of a formal nature they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq We don’t see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS because it’s them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened but certainly not destroyed because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world”Of course this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation as US House Representative from Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the US government from funding and supporting ISIL both directly and indirectly Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many“If you or I gave money weapons or support to alQaeda or ISIS we would be thrown in jail Why does our gov get a free pass on this The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia Turkey Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and alQaeda This madness must end We must stop arming terrorists The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its’ citizens” What is most interesting about Erdogan’s comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the US government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups when he has also been called out for doing the same Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of  perhaps Turkey or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the “Turkish Stream” pipeline in late October Additionally Moscow announced today that they will be “intensifying cooperation” between Turkey Iran and themselves within Syria Maybe just maybe Turkey has broken ties with the Western bankingpolitical cabal Time will tell It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL Time is shortNot only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo the biggest battle to date but they are being defeated in Mosul Iraq Today Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider alAbadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding Stranger things have happened We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next ,Turkey’s Erdogan Says US Supports ISIL ‘We Have Evidence With Pictures  Videos’,Fake

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS He’s been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism Still he is adamant in his allegations and says he’s got irrefutable evidenceHis claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the socalled “freedom fighters” or rebels the insulation the US has relied upon in arming training and financing Obama’s terrorist allies in the past It’s more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists our supposed enemy as anonymous factions under the White House subversiveIt’s beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods as being the “legitimizing factor” for aiding our terrorist enemies as the nonexistent moderate freedom fightersErdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has “confirmed evidence” that USled forces have supported ISIS Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that “it’s very clear” the US is supporting ISIS He said “They were accusing us of supporting Daesh ISIS Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh YPG PYD It’s very clear We have confirmed evidence with pictures photos and videos” YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against TurkeyFlanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde Erdogan said ”The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises Whether they do or they don’t we will continue along this path in a determined way There is no going back on the path we have set out on”Erdogan complained “They are supporting all the terror groups — the YPG PYD but also including Daesh ISIS  It’s quite clear perfectly obvious” he said adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims alleging “the West stands by Daesh ISIS right now” and its weapons were Westernmade At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspectionHe needs to be more forthcoming this time around If he’s got the evidence show it Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS it’s already well known We would like to put our hands on his proof though in order to properly charge Obama and convict him,urkey President Claims Has Video Evidence Obama Is Supporting ISIS,Fake
Finding a performer for the inauguration of Presidentelect Donald Trump has not been easy because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horsesJackie Evancho a teenage opera singer who got her start on America’s Got Talent has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration Many liberals have attacked her and her family but proud Americans have supported her Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people via BreitbartEvancho’s  “Dream With Me” album and her  “O Holy Night” are both sitting at No  on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girlFor her part Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it even though they were not even asked in the first place“I have recently been asked by the Presidentelect to perform the National Anthem for the swearingin ceremony at the inauguration” Evancho stated “I’m so excited It’s going to be awesome” At least someone has some American prideBut liberals of course aren’t about to hold back their disdain even against a teenage girl This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evancho’s family“My family is kind of a big target I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us” Evancho claimed “But I also get a lot of love So we pay most attention to that Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate everyone does we have to admit it but we just ignore it”So Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political viewsAt  Jackie Evancho’s list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums Her “O Holy Night EP” made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the US Billboard and also ranked her as the No  Classical Albums Artist of  one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trump’s inauguration the young singer clearly has a ton of talent The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming PresidentLiberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening The truth is Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they can’t get their way,WHOA – Liberals Attacked Trump Inauguration Singer But They Got KNOCKED OUT by America,Fake

It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all It’s just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats can’t do any job rightEntire precincts surrounding Detroit may be unrecountable due to suspected voter fraud Officials have found that in hundreds of cases the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts as per The Detroit NewsMichigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted then the original count must standSome of the problems may be due to biased elections staff The machines used in Michigan according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter are quite old In fact  of the machines’ optical scanners broke on election dayWhen there is such a problem with the machines a ballot may get jammed in the scanner The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again This could result in a ballot being counted twice or even six times as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and againThe staff can manually erase the duplicate votes but Baxter says that “in many cases  failed to do so” What they forgot Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple timesOf course many of these precincts are strongly Democrat at least according to historic voting trends This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly twothirds of the vote If such widespread voter fraud has occurred perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thoughtThere are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well As WND is reporting Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his District’s elections process Crider said in a Facebook post “Penny’s precinct Detroit Precinct  had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper The tag on the box said  and the book said  and the ticket said  so there should be  paper ballots on the box right”“Well when they pulled out the ballots the stack seemed short and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only guess how many ballots were in the box  no  nope  nada how about  wrong again There were only exactly  paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have  HMMMM” Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstanceIf the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there It would be understandable to be off by one vote but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points once again to the election staffIn my opinion each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again Whether through negligence or intention something very bad has been going on hereHT Angry Patriot MovementWhat do you think of these revelations from the Michigan recount effort Please share this story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice,BREAKING – Dems Caught Counting Hillary Votes  TIMES In THIS City TIME FOR PRISON,Fake

WASHINGTON DC AP — Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his privateparts The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over  timesThe tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trump’s hands“Look at those hands are they small hands” Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March “And he  referred to my hands ‘if they’re small something else must be small’ I guarantee you there’s no problem I guarantee it”Donald Trumps penis sizeA screenshot of Donald Trump’s tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted“He’s always calling me Little Marco And I’ll admit he’s taller than me” Rubio told ABC News “He’s like ’ which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is ’” Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday “And you know what they say about men with small hands You can’t trust them”The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or more precisely his fingers for yearsAs Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter recalled online last year “Just to drive him a little bit crazy I took to referring to him as a ‘shortfingered vulgarian’ in the pages of Spy magazine That was more than a quarter of a century ago”Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn’t surprised by Trump’s actions“Donald Trump is an egomaniac

WASHINGTON DC AP — US Sen Ted Cruz RTexas sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and selfsatisfaction’“Selflove is a silent killer in this country This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress but it quickly spirals out of control and before you know it your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from autoerotic asphyxiation I’m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil’s playground for good” Cruz said “I’m asking Mr Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem and commit to finding real solutions If he does that I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November Should Mr Trump decline I think it’s safe to say that all options including a third party run are out on the table”Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue“Look do I think Ted Cruz is right about this Maybe he is maybe he isn’t To be honest I don’t know a lot about this subject matter I don’t need to I have a wife that takes care of this for me and she’s a beautiful wife the best wife the greatest wife My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it the best answer there is I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for nonreproductive purposes illegal”This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of selfstimulation As solicitor general of Texas in  he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “Right to stimulate one’s genitals” Cruz eventually lost this battle but the story resurfaced this year and gained widespread media attention prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “A new belief of his” implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was in fact spent stimulating his own genitals Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates Matt Daemon has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story“All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then which is fine I guess but he was always real creepy about doing it Honestly I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked lotion and Kleenex next to him watching reruns of Walker Texas Ranger He wouldn’t even try and cover up when I caught him he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room It’s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one’s self that Ted has taken in this country I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can’t do it anymore then no one can”Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party“It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President” Bradley said “With all the real problems in this country like starvation so many people out of work and families living on the street Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime” Bradley continued “Also I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless it means so much Please donate what you can every bit helps”Cruz however remains undeterred by his detractors “When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep and they are weeping for this country  hours a day  days a week America needs strong moral leadership and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task The fate of our great nation is in his hands hopefully they’re big enough to handle it”Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter A recent poll by the New York Times found that  of likely Trump voters support a ban on selfstimulation due to moral and religious concerns Another  would be okay with a ban saying that they like Trump have far too many potential suitors and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges Only  of Trump supporters are against a banRNC political strategist  Paul Horner calls the move a “nobrainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz“Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue If Donald does not side with the Senator he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one no matter how creepy insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is”David Mikkelson founder of Snopescom a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to

New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newlyfound laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary Clinton and her crew away for life” NYPD sources told True PunditNYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insidersThe NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over  emails to and from Hillary Clinton Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on FridayBut new revelations on the contents of that laptop according to law enforcement sources implicate the Democratic presidential candidate her subordinates and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails sources said NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates toMoney launderingChild exploitationSex crimes with minors childrenPerjuryPay to play through Clinton FoundationObstruction of justiceOther felony crimesNYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief the department’s highest rank under Commissioner said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co conspirators NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father it turned my stomach” the NYPD Chief said “There is not going to be any Houdinilike escape from what we found We have copies of everything We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that”The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton“People are going to prison” he saidMeanwhile FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents who have taken over the nonsexting portions the case from NYPD The husbandandwife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals sources said“If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences” a federal law enforcement source saidNYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one highranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too sources saidProsecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records law enforcement sources confirmed NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin however the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas US Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulgeThe new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton President Bill Clinton Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing  on multiple occasions to his private island in the US Virgin Islands sources said Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitariesBoth NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions probably more when all the evidence is combed sources said Bill Clinton it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years that he too traveled with Epstein over  times to the islandLaptop Also Unveiled More Classified Top Secret BreachesAccording to other uncovered emails Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner’s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington DCWeiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweinercom Weiner a former seventerm Democratic Congressman from New York primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York CityAt one point FBI sources said Abedin and Clinton’s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner’s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shopHowever Weiner and Abedin who is Hillary Clinton’s closest personal aide weren’t the only people with access to the Weiner’s email account Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedin’s sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiner’s email account FBI sources confirmedFEC records show Weiner paid more than  of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site According to FBI sources the DCbased political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweinercom domain since  the same time Abedin was working at the State Department This means technically Weiner and Abedin’s emails including top secret State Department emails could have been accessed printed discussed leaked or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed FBI sources saidAccording to FBI sources the bureau’s newlyminted probe into Clinton’s use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state has also been broadened to include investigating new emailrelated revelations includingAbedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner’s emailAbedin stored emails containing government secrets in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over  archived State Department emailsWeiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the recordsAbedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemailcom address to sendreceivestore classified and top secret documentsA private consultant managed Weiner’s site for the last six years including three years when Clinton was secretary of state and therefore had full access to all emails as the domain’s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contactsBecause Weiner’s campaign website is managed by the thirdparty consultant and political email guru FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiner’s server and emails and who were these people Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers or other actorsAbedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didn’t know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept of State system Instead she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo Clintonemailcom and her email linked to WeinerAbedin said according to FBI documents she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept and print the documents many of which were classified and top secret from the largely unprotected webmail portalsClinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her Abedin said Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept fax machine installed in her Chappaqua NY home without assistancePerhaps more alarming according to the FBI’s  Report detailing its interview with Abedin none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner There was never a follow up according to the  reportBut now all that has changed with the FBI’s decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptop’s emails,BREAKING BOMBSHELL NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails Money Laundering Sex Crimes with Children Child Exploitation Pay to

CAMBRIDGE Ma – A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to US immigration policy“If we continue traveling at our current trajectory we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country” warned Dr Emilio Martinez Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office Dr Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a tenyear period “What we’ve seen is an incremental increase of twentythree per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border”The US Census Bureau projects the US population will reach just over  million people by  However according to Dr Martinez the current data doesn’t factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year “Our models show that if this trend continues the population of the United States by  will reach approximately  million with just under fortynine per cent consisting of American citizens” Martinez explained adding that the data is offset by a  margin of errorIn contrast the population of Mexico which currently rests at about  million is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due in part to rapidly changing climates and the country’s ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers “Mexicans as we’ve seen over the last quarter century – have already begun to emigrate north into the US and Canada” said Luis Garcia a thirdyear statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr Martinez “These numbers while relatively small are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades”Garcia’s data shows that by  a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia Mexico and Peru could see their populations dwindle below  million “These people aren’t simply disappearing” said Garcia “On the contrary they’re coming to the United States”,New Study Shows Illegal Immigrants to Outnumber Americans  to  by ,Fake

WASHINGTON DC AP — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election President Obama has signed Executive Order  which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December  Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers” Obama told reporters “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters We must investigate these claims The margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump”Under the President’s order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks This process is expected to take  days In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on Dec  with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral collegeNot surprisingly Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square They tried to rig this election against me but the American people didn’t allow that to happen President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want I said the system was rigged all along and this proves I was right”The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states We still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary”Paul Horner a professor of political science at UCLA believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States but there is nothing in the constitution that says that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes but because of the electoral college she still lost That decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on December  What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors not for the President Though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching That does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them”Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether“ is a f—king joke we should be using the popular vote instead It may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise Everyone should have an equal vote and that’s just not the case with the electoral college You know what the electoral college gave us It gave us George W Bush It gave us a war in Iraq and the worst recession since the great depression It’s time to bring our system into the  century I hope Obama fixes this because president Trump is going to be a nightmare”Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this” Obama said “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election Why wasn’t this news released earlier How many votes were lost because of this” Obama said “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December a recount will be ordered”If

Istanbul Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon not Neil Armstrong said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan yesterday during an iftar fastbreaking dinner hosted by the Turkish Green CrescentMr Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than  years before the beginning of the Appolo program vowing to build a mosque “in the crater” where they landed“It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in ” Erdogan said “In fact Muslim space explorers reached our satellite  years before that in  Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator Lagâri Hasan Çelebi the “Ottoman Rocket Man” who made the first successful manned rocket flight in  What you might not know is that he attempted to reach the moon two years later and could very well have succeeded”The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous  century Arab merchant and traveller Mehmed Zilli also known as Evliya Çelebi In his famous travelog he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a  rocket using  okka  kg or  lbs of gunpowder It took off from Sarayburnu a site below the Topkapi Palace in IstanbulAs Evliya Celebi wrote Lagari proclaimed before launch “O my sultan Be blessed I am going to talk to Jesus” before lighting the rocket’s gunpowder  He then ascended more than  meters in the air and landed in the sea hundreds of meters from his takeoff point Swimming ashore he allegedly reported “O my sultan Jesus sends his regards to you”This  engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi’s famous rocket flights but it’s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon in  Erdogan’s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims“Why do you not believe it Because you’ve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing just like you’ve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land” Erdogan said referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II’s conquest of Istanbul in  “This claim is not new A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim and I believe they are right NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottoman’s success during the Apollo  mission but we’ll try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up”The Turkish President did not however give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather themottomanThe description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesn’t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design This sketch shows the basic design as it is described but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurateThe story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians and most experts believe that it is impossible that the “aviator” could have survived a flight into outer spaceHis first flight was indeed addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters on November   in the episode “Crash and Burn”  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely however to Evliya Çelebi’s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the periodThe team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan but concluded that it would have been “extremely difficult” for a  figure without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques to land safely or even achieve thrust at all This conclusion was backed by the fact that although the reimagined rocket rose it exploded in midflight,“OTTOMANS WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE MOON” SAYS TURKISH PRESIDENT,Fake

CULLMAN Al – An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fiftynine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracyPosing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council – a fictional conservative action group – ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County Alabama under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election “We were really pleased with the turnout” said Matthew Breyer who heads ACORN’s northern Alabama office “We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days”Once residents were successfully registered to vote ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up “We wanted to get an idea of the average voter’s understanding of the election process” Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice However unbeknownst to participants the ballots had been slightly altered “Under the category ‘US PresidentUS Vice President’ you had the option for ClintonKaine centered inside a solid red rectangle” Breyer explained “Likewise the option for TrumpPence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle”Following the simulation’s conclusion ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than twothirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton “She won by a massive landslide” recalled Breyer “The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party”“This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country” said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King “This may have been a simulation but we’ve got multiple GOP leaders saying there’s going to be a rigged election next month There’s a legitimate fear that you’ll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result we’ll be forced to suffer another four years under Obama’s failed policies”In recent days Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him “Of course there is a largescale voter fraud happening on and before election day” the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday Trump has called on his supporters to closely monitor voting centers and has said that he will not willingly accept defeat in the event Clinton secures the presidencyS,Recent Study Shows Nearly Six in Ten Trump Supporters are Illiterate,Fake

NaturalNews If a thug points a gun to your head hands you a piece of paper and says “Sign this contract” is the contract legally bindingOf course it isn’t It was coerced under the threat of violence and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally bindingYet right now electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint threatened with being killed if they don’t change their votes to oppose Donald Trump The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo “psyop” means psychological operations which falsely claims the Russians “hacked” the election despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrativeThe Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington DC and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians“Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails phone calls and letters — and even death threats — in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday” reports the NY Post todayThe NY Post also reportsReports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states including Georgia Idaho Tennessee Arizona Utah and MichiganFor Michael Banerian a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector the harassment comes with a dark sideHe said he’s been getting death threats via email snail mail Twitter and Facebook“Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth” Banerian  told The Post on WednesdayLeftists are “kidnapping” electoral voters and holding them for ransomWhat you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election Yet the very existence of such persistent coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed Thus electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding They may be “reclaimed” by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their statesIn essence the political left — organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton — has “psychologically kidnapped” the electoral voters and they’re demanding a kind of “ransom” or they will be killed That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald TrumpIn other words this is a “political mugging” where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying “Your vote or your life”And if they manage to switch  electoral votes through such death threats the left will declare a “victory” for America proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being “heroes” for saving the countryUnbelievable isn’t it This is right out of the Kim JongUn playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship which is probably why the radical left loves it so much If you do what they want you’re heralded as a national hero If you don’t do what they want you get a bullet in the headThis really is the way liberals exert power by the way which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came outLawless democrats have no respect for real democracy… they’re pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly loseWhat these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists if they don’t get their way they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them Sound familiar Look up the history of China’s “Cultural Revolution”That’s the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba North Korea or Communist China And it’s perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left If they don’t get their way they threaten to kill everyone who opposes themI’ve got news for those who espouse such threats of violence coercion and lawlessness We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic And after we stop you we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason From there the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimesOnce President Trump is sworn into office I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters Those individuals must be arrested imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes including sedition Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic Such threats cannot go unpunishedHey we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good useIn observing all this I’ve come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war But I also believe a civil war won’t last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcementIt turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all That’s where we can put all the leftwing terrorists and traitors who tried but failed to overthrow the country There we’ll pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the leftwingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama a master of linguistic subterfugeOver time some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today After all we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they don’t agree with conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN the Washington Post and the New York TimesRemember The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives That’s why they are so traumatized by reality They’ve been poisoned programmed hypnotized and traumatized by the leftwing media for as long as they can rememberIt’s time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left That effort begins anew on January   which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day They last thing the left wants is Americans who aren’t subjected to a daily dose of leftwing propagandaStay tuned to NaturalNewscom and NewsTargetcom for more details as all this moves forward I’m also launching a new live broadcast show in  to cover breaking news in real time,Electoral voters now subjected to brutal wave of death threats and

Trump might be able to reverse it but it’s trickyHe’s only got a few weeks left to damage America’s energy independence Obama needs to work fast and he is Ever the creative one Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in  to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans The law was never intended to facilitate any such action as The Hill explains but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the lawObama will use a section of the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections Bloomberg and The New York Times reported citing sources familiar with the plansIt’s unclear however how large Obama’s protected areas will beThe action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement socalled  protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from ObamaObama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from  to  that excludes the Atlantic and ArcticBut that plan’s time period is limited and Presidentelect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishesPrevious presidents have used the  law rarely In each case they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular speciesIt’s unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessor’s actions under that law Congress may also step in to undo Obama’s actionsThis is a classic act of recklessness on Obama’s part – applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent and telling American oil companies they can’t explore gigantic portions of the world Just because he’s Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up if he canCan heMaybe The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obama’s headingoutthedoor finger in the eye to America’s oil industry if not necessarily the simplest would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law essentially nullifying Obama’s actions He could also amend Obama’s drilling lease plan for the period of  by adding more leases conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban themWhat Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obama’s action under the law is null and void at the executive level and substitute his own It’s not clear how much force of law Obama’s action has although it’s not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute – albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statuteI suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obama’s actions unilaterally there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trump’s actionThere is some luxury of time here because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance and that could also be a challenge for Trump’s new EPAIn the meantime Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a leftwing ideological agenda If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback Instead he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor and for the nation to deal withAs relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary the end of President Obama can’t come soon enough either,Heading out the door Obama bans offshore drilling in Atlantic Arctic Oceans,Fake

The Berlin attack is opening people’s eyes to the situation at hand and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS but they’re not the only ones facing people’s wrathGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed  people—because of her open immigration policies as per The SunMany people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take themBut there’s one problem with these refugees—wherever they go attacks murders and rapes are increasing Anywhere where these migrants are violence followsIt’s not looking good for the chancellor who is up for reelection soon She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people“These are Merkel’s dead” said Marcus Pretzell chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North RhineWestphalia Klaus Bouillon of Merkel’s CDU party also said to Saarland radio “We must state that we are in a state of war although some people who want to see only the good cannot see”Merkel was attending the ironically named “International Day of Migrants” when the attack took place and she stated she was “shocked and shaken” by the tragedy that had taken place Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbyeThe German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach Cologne Hamburg Frankfurt Dortmund Dusseldorf Stuttgart and BielefeldMerkel’s opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countriesThis is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countries—violence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims there is one bent on destruction Many other countries including America have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrantsThey all need to go back to their own countries plain and simple It’s like being in a destructive relationship—they’re already going to tear themselves down but if you cutsling you don’t have to go down with them And the American people are not going down with themAnd I’m sure that the German people don’t want to go down either Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet It’s time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants because it’s only hurting the countries that take them in,Dear Media LIARS Here’s Who Is REALLY Responsible For Berlin Terror Attack,Fake
Donald Trump is responding to Bill Clinton’s statement in a very presidential way giving the American people the truth as opposed to the Democrats’ liesBill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get “angry white men” to vote for him and Trump responded by saying that Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused too much on the wrong states as per Fox NewsHillary’s husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton who deserves itThe fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign and that’s why she lost You would think she would have done so much better due to the fact that this wasn’t her first rodeo but it bombed It was DOA Dead On ArrivalRegarding Bill’s statement that Trump called him after the election Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful if unconventional campaignIt was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to seeHillary’s campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances Donald Trump hopped from state to state practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choiceShe failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest She probably viewed them as “beneath her” and not worth her precious time She was so sure that she was going to win that she didn’t even bother trying to sell herself in enough statesThe Clintons lost because of her and her campaign’s mistakes but who do they blame They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillary’s email scandal  days before the election which did hurt her numbersBut frankly if you’re going to complain about that then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you won’t be in the situation in the first place It’s as simple as that but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victimsDonald Trump’s response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people Trump doesn’t wait for the mainstream media to twist his words—he delivers them himselfTrump is our presidentelect and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday So all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothing—they have once again failed They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game but it won’t change the outcome that Trump is the president and Hillary Clinton is not,ALERT – Trump Issues AMAZING Response to Bill Clinton’s Disgusting Insults,Fake
Just before the presidential election there seemed to be a new woman coming forward every day claiming to have been sexually harassed by The Donald TrumpIt could also be that there isn’t much merit to such claims of abuse Trump has been in the public eye for long time  – and yet every single one of his accusers waited until within one month of a national election to come forward They’re all aware of how wealthy the man is and could’ve come forward years or in some cases decades ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true The fact that they didn’t bother to do so gives me the impression that they’re looking for attention – or to sway the electionSummer Zervos the ExApprentice loser who claimed Donald Trump sexually assaulted her was paid  by lawyer Gloria Allred to fabricate the story Allred is a Hillary Clinton collaborator and DNC Assosciate According to an anonymous source this deal was reportedly shopped around to other exApprentice contestants which makes sense nowEveryday for about a week we saw one accuser after another come forth We must share this to as many people as we can to vindicate Donald Trump  Zervos’ sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a “completely fabricated hoax” Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred which is being paid out “slowly over time”  Zervos was a big league Trump supporter who converted her whole family to the Trump Train until she met Gloria Allred as was reported before Money talks,Trump Accuser Was Paid  TO LIE FOR HILLARY,Fake

The  GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee he came out in support of a major policy of the man who’s been called upon to lead our nation“Let’s not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways Let’s follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington” Paul wrote in an oped for Breitbart“We have tried it before” Paul wrote “In fact the most successful Republican presidents and a few Democrats led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less” Indeed there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy These men were Ronald Reagan and John F KennedyWhen we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our  president he had little economic experience and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in  that rivaled the one of  He set out to determine how to get the country back on trackAs Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time in Kennedy’s first year in office he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches However growth was only at a stagnant  percent He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of  percent Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader The tax cut became law in  and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annuallyOne of Kennedy’s other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts He devised his own plan and it passed the Senate by a  vote in  The nation enjoyed a longterm growth rate of roughly four percent per yearIn  the economy is not completely bleak but it could be much better The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents’ terms but as Rand Paul noted even when George W Bush attempted a modest tax cut it gave the nation a boost for a period of timeIn standing with Donald Trump’s ambitious tax cut plans Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deservesIf Trump doesn’t follow through and it is just a “read my lips” moment he will probably be a oneterm president He has Paul’s support so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it once more “Great Again”,BREAKING – Rand Paul Stands Up For TRUMP Says What All Of Us Were Thinking,Fake
US Agency for International Development’s USAID worked in Afghanistan from July  through June  under the Obama administration The work there included supporting  Afghan health facilities They spend nearly  million through the Partnership Contracts for Health ProgramThe logic seems sounds in a country at war we can help by providing health care Unfortunately it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasksOn the website the USAID claims that during the current administration “The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations” This must be code for “We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them” because this is exactly what the group has doneSpecial Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction SIGAR John Sopko wrote to the agency stating “One Afghanistan hospital funded by the US Agency for International Development was located more than  miles away from the listed coordinates while another  facilities were more than six miles away”The letter elaborated “SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at  of  facilities in Badakhshan” – an Afghan province – but “was unable to locate one facility SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these  health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water”The money to help is going somewhere else…Sopko went on to say that only  of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided This means that only about  of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to beIn some cases the coordinates given were not even in the correct country “coordinates for  of the  facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan Afghanistan’s neighboring country to the southeast”One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID Others were miles from the reported coordinates “four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates and another three were between three and six miles away Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location”It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID “As SIGAR has stressed previously robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided” Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle SmithA USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem “The agency no longer maintains location data and “obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government which USAID was unwilling to make”Sopko countered this statement ““USAID’s position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities”It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated “Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services”Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening the agency will go on funding health centers providing another  million for the facilities In turn the United States will keep funding USAID The bizarre circle of corruption will continueUSAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward USAID “does not intend to maintain coordinates” They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilitiesGiven this set of facts the US needs to withdraw its funding of the agency Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen thoughThe facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition “e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities such as cracked walls leaking roofs broken doors and shattered windows” which “indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety”  Inspectors also found “exposed wiring Electrical deficiencies such as exposed live wires pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff”Horrible conditionsThis brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pitMillions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed Millions more will be given before this funding runs outWhy is nobody in Washington asking questionsThe answers will leave the White House with Obama His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of AfghanistanAs usual this is all lies A more likely scenario given what we know now is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of “health clinics” was believable at the timeNo more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every AmericanPresident Trump needs to undo all of these  “projects” so that we no longer operate maliciously negligently or in a corrupt manner,Undeniable Foul Play US Funded Facilities In Afghanistan Now “Missing” As Obama Leaves Office,Fake

Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian He’s since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist whitehating Muslim agitator but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearerThere were those who knew what he was up to but their silence had been purchased One such individual was Preeta Bansal who may or may not share Obama’s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime being a naturalized Indian Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and antiwhite antiAmerican  the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch That’s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ “Civil Rights” Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or nonwhite Discriminating against whites and Christians is just “who we are” under this racist Americahating IslamistOne thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration Racebased preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in Being Arab alone wasn’t enough to get you onto the good list Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not includedShe also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers Two questions rise from that admission what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she knowing their background difficulties still include them as potential recruitsThe WikiLeaks Podesta email from October of  forwarded to John Podesta which contains the Bansal correspondence is linked here and belowFwd FW Asian American

compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim Americancandidates for top Administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outsideboardsagenciespolicy committees A couple things to note about the listof Muslim American candidates  In the candidates for top jobs I excluded those with some ArabAmerican background but who are not Muslim eg George Mitchell ManyLebanese Americans for example are Christian In the last list ofoutside boardscommissions most who are listed appear to be MuslimAmerican except that a handful where noted may be Arab American but ofuncertain religion esp Christian  There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for aSecretarylevel job among the Muslim Americans That said on both liststhere are some very senior people listed in the last category for outsideboardscommissions who conceivably could be considered for top jobs Thevery senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terriblyinvolved in politics or policy or in the case of some Asian Americanshad already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so Ithought we should seek new talent But there’s no magic to some of theplacements I think the lists are fairly exhaustive but some of thepeople may be moved to other categories  Highprofile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amountof blogger criticism and so the individuals on this list would need to beESPECIALLY carefully vetted I suspect some of the people I list wouldnot survive such a vet — but I do personally know at least in partvirtually all of the candidates in the  two categories but I know veryfew of those listed for outside boardscommissions  I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the endof the second category but for various reasons I didn’t think any

The Obama administration refuses to even utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ so it’s no surprise that they have refused to call the murders of Christians by ISIS ‘genocide’ but that’s exactly what it is ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they doWhen the House votes  against Obama you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White HouseFrom Fox NewsThe House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East — putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this weekThe resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of  resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS’ atrocities The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is in fact genocide“When ISIS systematically targets Christians Yezidis and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination this is not only a grave injustice—it is a threat to civilization itself” Rep Jeff Fortenberry RNeb said in a statement “We must call the violence by its proper name genocide”The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March  deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration The measure is an effort to force the administration’s hand on the issue as the administration has so far declined to take an official positionThere is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted onObama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obama’s notionsIf the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama,BOOM The House Just Voted  In Support of Christians… Obama Isn’t Happy About This,Fake

WASHINGTON DC AP — Early this morning President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order  which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance Under the new order it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite or encourage others to recite the pledge while on duty This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to  and up to one year in federal prisonDuring the press conference the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values”“The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is” Obama said “Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah’s Witnesses Amish Muslims and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism By calling this ‘one nation under God’ we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home By saying ‘liberty and justice for all’ we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice”Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of “under God” runs afoul of the First Amendment’s establishment clause He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America’s values“I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge something that is includes everyone’s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith”Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election She echoed his concerns about the pledge’s language and suggested that the pledge’s mention of God sends the wrong message to America’s children“I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today In January when I take office as the next President of the United States unless I see otherwise I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect”Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president’s order referring to the president as an “illegitimate Muslim traitor”“As a Christian nation the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there the best there is greater than all the other children in this world combined Obama who founded ISIS by the way wants them not to be great he wants them to be weak and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools he has proven that here today This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe”Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks spoke to ABC News about the ban“This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools” Bradley said “I just want to say a big thanks to every Godfearing Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless Please donate what you can every bit helps so much”Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama’s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control“When our children are forced to chant ‘One nation under God‘ whose God are they referring to exactly” Ketchum said “From birth children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child’s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values” Ketchum continued “This is a great day not just for Atheists but for all Americans who value freedom Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control”While Executive Order  is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans constitutional scholar Paul Horner told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court“Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace it is well within the traditional scope of a president’s executive authority to pass this law Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed”Fappy The AntiMasturbation Dolphin a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing“It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us unless we masturbate then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity”David Mikkelson founder of Snopescom a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral and we spend a minute or two debunking it we make lots of money Stories like this have helped put my children through college buy a new car a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy” Mikkleson said “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘ but that’s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that’s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons” Mikkleson continues “A typical story of ours makes wild claims using grammatical errors misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’ ‘recycled’ ‘hoax’ saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’ but we list no links or sources of information they are all just outrageous accusations by us And that story will get  shares or more on Facebook that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences” Mikkelson further explains “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar it’s so funny We also like to post fake unfunny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is  fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money” Mikkelson laughs “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are  proven false but since we block archiveorg it just becomes their word versus ours Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademarkprotected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘ But we don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It’s just more of our hack unethical journalism and as I said before I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click our ads regardless bottom line so why do the extra work”Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in  The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in  and formally adopted by Congress in  The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in  and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in  when the words “under God” were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor Michigan were taking

WASHINGTON DC AP — Early this morning President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order  which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide Under the new order it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events this is where the new order will have its biggest impact Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to  dollars and up to one year in federal prisonThe president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is “violent” and “hostile to African Americans”“If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco  Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything it’s that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse Our nation is being torn apart by a song a song that is outdated and jingoistic Without swift action we cannot move forward as a nation we cannot heal the wounds of racial division How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing”Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation“The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end” Obama said “We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming not the nation we used to be”It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color”In a relatively short period of time his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America but about what exactly it means to be a patriotDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election She echoed his concerns about the anthem’s militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slaveryRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order“The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds” Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa “I can tell you that when I’m elected I’ll have them

linebacker Brandon Marshall who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem called this “A great day not just for African Americans but for all Americans who value freedom” He said that

Charleston SC — Just one day after the Democratic Primary legendary actor comedian and writer Bill Murray brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston South Carolina speaking to an estimated crowd of over  cheering fans and supporters“Hello South Carolina Are you ready to get weird or what” Murray said to the roaring crowdMurray’s speech which lasted a little more than an hour touched on many issues from his campaign including increased wages health care the cost of higher education and human rights in general The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke“I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach” Murray told the crowd “Here are grown men candidates running for President of the United States and they’re acting like  They’re up there on stage broadcasted to the entire world calling each other names interrupting each other making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself I think the American people deserve better than this I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this”Political analyst Paul Horner told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago“I don’t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he’s just having some fun but the man is making some excellent points out there He’s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it I applaud Mr Murray for what he’s doing”“I pretty much don’t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now” Murray told the crowd “I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy but the rest of em’ are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion” Murray continued “I’m always traveling around the world but I’m proud to call America the good ole’ US of A my home I think there’s a lot of great people here a lot of potential but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate right now People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wannabe’s like Donald Trump and the Ted Cruz’s who want to start World War III They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has and because of that you see them leading in the polls And it’s sad that people go along with it and can’t see it for what it really is”Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President“We need a new face in Washington Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought” Bradley said “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless Bill made a donation right there on the spot saying what we were doing was amazing he’s such a great guy He truly cares about people and making the world a better place”Murray finished the rally by saying “I’m no hero I just want to help out and I hope you all choose to stand behind me or beside me or wherever is comfortable for you but just as long as it’s with me Look we don’t need to make America great again because it already is we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible”Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican Democrat or IndependentDavid Mikkelson founder of Snopes a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing“This type of story when it goes viral and we debunk it we make money” Mikkelson said “The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one it’s actually quite simple First we start with the same cookiecutter outline we use for every site that we debunk Next we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours After that one of our “writers” will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted And now last but not least we slap a title on there similar to the article’s headline that we’re debunking This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story and that’s it Then we just sit back and let the money roll in We are the absolute definition of clickbait I’ll tell what if it wasn’t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner putting out the stories that he does my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college” Holding back tears Mikkelson finishes by saying “Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site” so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon”Murray’s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March  and then the Tempe Improv later that night It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting

ALBANY NY  A businessman who cochaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife weren’t meant for publication but were nevertheless “inappropriate” and a “mistake”Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publication’s survey to only go to a couple friends not the newspaper He said he mistakenly hit “reply” on his computer instead of “forward”The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would “return to being a male”In Paladino’s Tuesday statement first reported on Buffalo’s WBEN radio he apologizes to minorities saying he “never intended to hurt” them with his antiObama remarks The comments sparked outrage from various political circles including Trump’s transition team which called the developer’s comments “absolutely reprehensible”Paladino’s comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William who runs the family’s development firm The younger Paladino called the statements “disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary”The father’s earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St Bonaventure University his alma mater and recipient of more than  million in donations from Carl Paladino over the yearsPaladino a school board member since  also said he won’t resign his elected position on the board“No I’m not leaving the school board” he said in the statement “not when it’s time to help implement the real choice elements of Trump’s plan for education reform”The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to “discuss board member conduct” In New York school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissionerPaladino  unsuccessfully ran for governor in  as a Republican The Democrat who defeated him Gov Andrew Cuomo called the comments about the Obamas “racist ugly and reprehensible”Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists performers and business owners for their New Year’s wish listAsked what he would most like to happen in  Paladino responded that he hoped “Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations” with a cow dies and is buried in a cow pasture Asked who he would like to see “go away” he said Michelle Obama “I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie the gorilla” he wrote In an emailed statement to the AP Paladino  claimed his comments had “nothing to do with race” but instead reflected his opinion of the president’s performance in office “Merry Christmas and tough luck if you don’t like my answer” he wrote As recently as August Paladino falsely claimed Mr Obama was not Christian telling the New York Observer that to average Americans “There is no doubt he is a Muslim” And in  Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr Obama as a pimp Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website Instead that statement ripped the Obamas calling the president a “yellowbellied coward” and claiming the first lady “hated America before her husband won” the White House,Carl Paladino Trump campaign NY cochair says his derogatory Obama remarks were a mistake,Real

JERUSALEM  Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received “ironclad” information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last week’s UN resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegalThe allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing Obama administration in the wake of Friday’s vote and raised questions about whether the White House might take further action against Israeli settlements in its final weeks in officeWith the US expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote The UN votes impact on USIsrael relationsPlay VIDEOThe UN votes impact on USIsrael relationsAlthough the US has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands it has traditionally used its veto in the UN Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure But in a change of policy it abstained from Friday’s vote allowing the resolution to pass by a  marginIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama has called the resolution “shameful” and accused the US of playing a leading role in its passageOn Tuesday his spokesman went even further“We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage” David Keyes said“We’re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution” he said How UN resolution against Israel will impact US relationsPlay VIDEOHow UN resolution against Israel will impact US relationsHe did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information Israel has close security ties with Egypt an original sponsor of last week’s resolution Under heavy Israeli pressure Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measureKeyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu who told his Cabinet on Sunday “From the information that we have we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it stood behind it coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed”Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians with overwhelming world support claim for their state   US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the US abstention saying “We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn’t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians” And she added that the vote “does not in any way diminish the United States’ steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel”  Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace CBS News’ Margaret Brennan reports “The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades” Power saidIsrael’s recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahu’s hand the incoming Trump Administration In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a US veto After the vote Trump vowed that “things will be different after Jan ” Critically he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements his longtime attorney David Friedman as ambassador to Israel And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which even many Israelis fear could spark violence The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem home to sensitive religious sites as the capital of the future state to which they aspire After Friday’s vote Netanyahu’s office said he looked forward to working with Trump “to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution”   It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do While he will be able to wield the US veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council mustering enough votes to overturn Friday’s decision appears to be impossible The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country Israel has said the law doesn’t apply because the territory was captured from Jordan which has renounced all claims to the land Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds When Netanyahu’s rivals in Israel oppose the settlements it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand but rather for concern for Israel’s democracy If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank it will have to grant its  million Palestinians voting rights or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy The country is toxically divided on the issue and key sectors of society including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment want to see settlements end Many of them welcome  some openly and many more quietly  any world pressure to bring that about Dan Miodownik a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist  ,Israel claims ironclad proof that the Obama administration was behind UN rebuke,Real

WASHINGTON — Republicans are united on repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law but ideologically and practically speaking they’re in different camps over replacing it Getting the factions together won’t be easySome Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare  junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance while preserving wellliked parts Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act or ACA and not replace it Can Congress put aside differences in the new yearPlay VIDEOCan Congress put aside differences in the new yearPresidentelect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical wellbeing of millions of people For some constituents in fragile health it’s literally a lifeanddeath debateRepublicans have “a really narrow path” says GraceMarie Turner of the Galen Institute a freemarket health care research organization “They’ve got to deal with the politics of this they’ve got to make sure they come up with good policy and they also have process challenges”Success is not guaranteed and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to ObamacareYet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge “It’s like tax reform” says Brady a Texas Republican explaining that many pieces will be pulled together “Unlike Obamacare which ripped up the individual market this will be done deliberately in an appropriate timetable”Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement Here’s a look at the GOP camps and who’s in themRevise and rebrandMany Republicans may quietly be in this contingent but fear being accused of promoting ObamacareliteThey’d strip out some of the ACA’s taxes and requirements The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate Rules on insurers would be loosenedBut popular provisions such as protecting those with preexisting health conditions would be retained in some form as well as financial assistance for low and moderateincome people The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age  would be fairly easy to preserve since employers have accommodated itA rebranded version of Obama’s law may well cover fewer people But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage underwritten by governmentMany GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA That includes major players among hospitals insurers and pharmaceuticalsTrump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law but his bottom line remains unknownBudget hawks For budget hawks unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare and placing a costconscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverageBudget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health careHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp and his “Better Way” agenda is its roadmap Georgia Rep Tom Price Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services is a budget hawk Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his careerThe problem for budget hawks is that the  political campaign did not give them a mandate Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed Trump said he wouldn’t cut Medicare and sent conflicting signals on MedicaidMany Democrats can’t wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks Betting that will backfire House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against “attacks on the ACA and Medicare”The ripitup society The most conservative lawmakers want to “pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed” says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz That sentiment is embodied by the  or so members of the House Freedom Caucus and it’s probably broadly shared among conservativesSome do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care and they couldn’t care less about replacing the ACA“They would say that Obama’s plan has failed” said LuntzGOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possibleTrump calls the ACA “a disaster” and that’s pleasing to those farthest on the right It’s unclear if he’d walk their walkPragmatists At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a president’s desk GOP Sens Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatistsThey may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this campThe biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation While repealing most of “Obamacare” is possible with a simple majority in the Senate  votes would probably be needed for a replacement There will only be  GOP senators next year“Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremonyand I expect them to have one” said Dan Mendelson CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health “On the other hand there’s  million people with health insurance under the ACA and they don’t want to dump them There’s no clear path for how to square that conflict”,GOP in Congress split over how to repeal Obamacare,Real

protected To help fulfill this promise the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality ends genderbased violence and promotes economic and political participation—finding ways to improve them along with hundreds of other requestsOur original post continuesThe topic also came up at Thursdays daily State Department briefing — but NPRs Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the requestIn a report for our Newscast unit Michele quotes Kirby as saying To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team we will certainly provide them the context the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forwardKirby acknowledged that there could be anxiety at a time of transition but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documentsAddressing his agencys approach to gender issues Kirby told a reporter Obviously gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority Secretary Kerry has made them a priority Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority and it remains one for us hereKirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities saying that in a hypothetical case if there were issuespecific names requested obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed alongShortly after the transition teams email became public the Twitter account of the State Departments PoliticalMilitary Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women Peace  Security — a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President ObamaIn response to reports about the memo Sen Jeanne Shaheen DNH who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a statement saying in partIn light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team todays report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent Women and girls equality is transformative for communities and economies and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls protect women from trafficking end child marriage and combat genderbased violenceThe Trump teams request which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trumps transition team to name employees working on climate changeAs NPRs Brakkton Booker has reported the Trump teams  questionnaire on climate change raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the

Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a shorttermfunding bill to keep the government running and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadlineIts become a familiar yearend act for Congress passing a shorttermfunding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months This funding measure which passed  runs out in AprilDespite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting minersThe stopgap includes  million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year Democrats led by West Virginias Joe Manchin wanted a fullyear extension but with little leverage and a shutdown looming they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four monthsWould I have preferred that provision to be more generous Of course I would have said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell But well be back at it in April and I think its highly unlikely that well take it awayWith House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday — and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations — Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdownThe spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April  Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until Presidentelect Donald Trump assumes office With control of both the White House and Congress Republicans will have more sway over how roughly  trillion is spent on federal agencies and programsThe bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year  spending bills because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next yearSince the spending bill is a mustpass measure it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures For instance Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trumps defense secretary nominee retired Gen James MattisFor Mattis to be confirmed Congress must waive a law that requires a sevenyear coolingoff period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post Mattis retired in  objected to the language but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees and it will need to pass a  threshold in the SenateMattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation processThe measure also includes just over  billion in Overseas Contingency Funding better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and AfghanistanAn additional  billion is directed to disaster relief including recovery efforts from Hurricane MatthewDemocrats also secured funding to assist the Flint Mich community with repairing its drinking water systems Some  million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and childrenCongress approved a biomedical research bill this week and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation such as  million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and  million to states to combat the opioid epidemicThe measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress The pay freeze has been in place since ,No Government Shutdown Senate Passes Funding Bill After Democrats Back Down,Real
As debate about Obamacare’s future moves from people’s general mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with preexisting medical conditions are affectedAcross the US people who have cancer heart disease diabetes or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns And a substantial number of people could be affectedA Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost  of US adults younger than  have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a preACA world Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effect–but only at premiums they could not afford Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states there are more than  million in Texas for example and in blue states nearly  million in California As the chart above shows however the  states with the largest shares of adults who have preexisting conditions are all controlled by Republicans and most are in the South These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA such as obesity and diabetesStill even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding preexisting conditions Kaiser’s monthly health tracking poll found in August that  of Americans said that they or a family member had a preexisting condition after being read a definition of the term Most people with preexisting conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid Before the ACA however they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances Because so many people with a preexisting condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changesPresidentelect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have preexisting medical conditions Details of Republican healthcare plans are not yet known but they are expected to involve establishing highrisk pools within states among other measures Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will beTens of millions of people with preexisting medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected It’s sometimes said that this has become a postfactual world But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda people will want to know how changes would affect them and details and facts will matter more again,Preexisting Conditions and Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare,Real

Like many foreign scientists in Britain Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union The biology lecturer a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the airIm worried that after my current contract finishes one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card she said Id like to apply for EU grant money but how much longer will it be available forBritains top universities have long been among the worlds most soughtafter destinations for study and research drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe But since Britons voted in June to leave the  EU many in the science community say the UK risks losing the money the international influence — and crucially the talent — to sustain that enviable positionMore than onetenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years Some fields — such as nanotechnology and cancer research — are more dependent on EU funding than others according to a report by technology firm Digital Science From  to  Britain received  billion euros  billion in direct EU investment in researchBagniewska is not just anxious about herself — shes upset for her students future too for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for grantedThey were just getting excited about doing their masters and PhDs in other countries And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled she saidScientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries The blocs freedom of movement means its  million people can live and work visafree in any member stateNo one knows yet what form Britains exit from the EU — commonly known as Brexit — is going to take but immigration was a key issue for Leave voters Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to BritainPrime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the  Europeans who make up  percent of the academic workforce in British universities Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afieldScientists for EU an advocacy group says it has received over  letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold One said their employer a London university immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research incomeAdam Durrant a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers says hes now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain Part of the reason he says is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than beforeIn the future it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the UK to work said Durrant Theres a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future I will certainly retain a UK presence but my companys focus of gravity may shift elsewhereScientists say some UKbased researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleaguesPaul Crowther head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum The vote put the UKbased researchers in a very awkward position and their participation in EUfunded programs could compromise the project he was toldThe erosion of UK involvement in EU networks has already begun with both the UK and EU science worse off Crowther saidApart from a loss of grant money Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructureLargescale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases the building of large facilities are areas that multinational collaborations do much better said Venki Ramakrishnan a Nobel Prizewinning biologist and president of Britains prestigious Royal SocietyThe EU is an important source of research funding for Britain which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science In  Britains government spent under  percent of its GDP on research — below the European average and half that of South KoreaMays government is clearly aware of the jitters She has promised to increase annual investment in research by  billion pounds  billion by  in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovationDurrant is doubtful thats enough to make a big differenceTwo billion a year spread across everything isnt going to go very far he saidSimilar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level The  European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year — but no one knows what will happen after thatFewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britains most competitive university courses including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge In September the admission service UCAS reported a  percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in  argue that Britain could become like Switzerland an associate EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projectsIts not all doom and gloom — but it will be harder Ramakrishnan said We could make a go of it outside the EU But for that to happen we have to attract talent and fund science And those two things are critical,Brexit

Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is “openminded” about climate change  but also that “nobody really knows” the truth about the issue which contradicts the fact that there is nearuniversal scientific agreement on the issueIn an interview with “Fox News Sunday” moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr Trump  that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations to head the Environmental Protection Agency Where Wallace asked does Mr Trump stands on climate change“I’m very openminded I’m still openminded” he said “Nobody really knows”However there is a nearuniversal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon  despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians NASA’s website on climate change for example notes that approximately  percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperaturesHis comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with  questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policiesThe questionnaire obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News asks for example “Which programs within  are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan”Mr Trump’s answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month  after a campaign in which Mr Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a “hoax” invented by China“I have a very open mind” he said at the time “And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully But I have an open mind”Still Mr Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt  whom many environmental groups immediately blasted  was to “speed up the process” for permit approvals and other EPA business“If you look at what China’s doing If you look at what  I could name country after country” he said “You look at what’s happening in Mexico where our people are just  plants are being built and they don’t wait  years to get an approval to build a plant okay They build it like the following day or the following week We can’t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs”As for the Paris Agreement the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall Mr Trump said he is “studying” the agreement  but that he worries it will put the US at a “competitive disadvantage” International energy and environment experts worry that Mr Trump who said earlier this year that he would “tear up” the Paris deal could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy“Paris I’m studying” he said “I do say this I don’t want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries And as you know there are different times and different time limits on that agreement I don’t want that to give China or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us”,Contradicting settled science Donald Trump says nobody really knows on climate change,Real

Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama’s signature healthcare law beginning on the first day of the new Congress before Presidentelect Donald Trump is even sworn inBut the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it and how long a transition period to allow before the law’s insurance would go awayHardliners are pushing to move as fast as possible bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far too fastWhile Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom a full replacement could take months if not years“I’d like to do it tomorrow but reality is another matter sometimes” said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the “repeal and replace” efforts “We have to live with the real world And the real world right now is that the Democrats won’t help with anything”SDonald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act otherwise known as Obamacare once he gets into office Now that hes won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate that feat might not prove to be too easy Wonkblogs Max Ehrenfreund explains Daron TaylorThe Washington PostHatch and other highranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until  or beyond allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm electionsMany of them like Sen Susan Collins RMaine have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly“I don’t want to leave the  people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because all of a sudden twothirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy” Collins saidBut those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues — many of them sent to Congress in the midterm antiObama waves of  and  — who see little reason to dawdle“The history of this place is the longer it takes the more exponentially the probability grows that it’ll never get done” said Rep Mark Meadows RNC elected recently as the new chairman of the hardright House Freedom Caucus “Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years so why do we need three years”Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now Their footdragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits Trump has also been vague promising a “terrific” replacement that will provide “great health care at a fraction of the cost”The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare’s sunset But other fights loom — over what precisely a replacement plan should look like whether Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will continue whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan  Jonathan ErnstReutersThe battle lines however are familiar with “establishment” Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents mainly in the House on the other Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio to retireCome Jan  Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a healthcare overhaul the real fight will occur inside the GOPSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan  But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance marketsSo far Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute“We’re going to repeal Obamacare lock stock and barrel” Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently “The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people”Hardliners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep Tom Price RGa Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary as allies in their push for quick and decisive action Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill “with all deliberate speed” but pledged only to then “set into motion a process to replace it”House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis said Thursday that Republicans would move “as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people”Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing“The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace” he saidConservative activists who pushed a takenoprisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited“When Republicans have the House the Senate and the White House you don’t wait” said Adam Brandon president and chief executive of FreedomWorks a conservative advocacy group “I’m a Cleveland Indians fan I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades When you have a shot to do it you do it That’s it”Democrats and many healthcare experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges More than  million Americans are covered under those policiesHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare’s insurance exchanges according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closeddoor meeting“Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers providers consumers and states” Burwell told reporters after the meetingRepublicans want to end Obamacare’s system of penalties and subsidies But many — including Trump — want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sickExperts warn that “repeal and delay” under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market Linda J Blumberg a senior fellow at the Urban Institute said insurers could face as much as  billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated“That  billion is the tip of the iceberg” Blumberg said “With all of these changes and the uncertainty it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get”Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers“The insurance industry should understand that there’s a new sheriff in town” said Rep Ken Buck RColo a Freedom Caucus member “They signed up for Obamacare and if they want to make a profit they’re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a freemarket insurance industry”The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base but also Senate arithmeticThere will be a slim  Republican majority come January and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules passing a complete replacement will require  votesOnly by dismantling Obamacare first Republicans say will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan — and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so“We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all” Hatch saidIncoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E Schumer DNY however has rejected that strategy “We’re not going to do a replacement If they repeal without a replacement they will own it” he told The Washington Post recentlyBut the Republican base prodded by conservative media outlets and wellorganized activist groups has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inactionOne prominent activist Jenny Beth Martin cofounder of the Tea Party Patriots suggested that Trump could goose the repealandreplace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to  congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law“I don’t think anyone thinks that you’re going to flip a switch  but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly” she said “We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done”Brandon was even blunter “This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans but tough ” he said “They’re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers and guess what It’s hard“The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place” he added “The old excuses of having divided government they’re gone”A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit “They have to look at the complexity of the problem here and hopefully they’ll recognize that it’s not quite so simple” said Sen Ron Johnson RWis who was first elected in the  tea party waveBut many others are not“Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress” said Rep Mark Walker RNC a firsttermer who will chair the

Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia’s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the presidentelect’s expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to RussiaSens Lindsey O Graham RSC and John McCain RAriz — the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee — joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E Schumer NY and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed RI for a thorough bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the US elections Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA’s private conclusion that Russia’s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump“Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American” the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning “Democrats and Republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks”“This cannot become a partisan issue The stakes are too high for our country We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security” they added Republican senators John McCain Arizona and Lindsey Graham South Carolina have been highly have been highly critical of Donald Trump’s comments about Russia Michael ReynoldsEPABut McCain and Graham — who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election — have often bucked Republican leaders and their embrace of a wideranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKySen Susan Collins Maine one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber suggested a bipartisan investigation may be “useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries”“The purpose of any investigation whether by the Obama administration or Congress is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election” she said in a statement “Instead any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign”Another GOP senator — Sen James Lankford Okla who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee — agreed with McCain and Graham’s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the US elections“Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can’t be partisan” Lankford tweeted SundayMeanwhile the Senate Intelligence Committee’s chairman Richard Burr RNC said Sunday that the panel “will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters”But he made no specific mention of Russia unlike Sen Ron Johnson RWis said cyber threats by America’s “rivals” including Russia pose “serious challenges” that should not be “politicized or viewed through a partisan lens”Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would “continue to hold hearings based on fact — not innuendo — for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures”Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wideranging investigation into Russia’s electionrelated activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as “ridiculous” They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the presidentelect before he is even inaugurated Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin whom he praised during the campaign“I think it’s just another excuse I don’t believe it  No I don’t believe it at all” Trump said of the CIA charges on “Fox News Sunday” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBS’s “Face the Nation” saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were “laughable and ridiculous”Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing a tradition for presidents and presidentselect He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the electionA US intelligence official said it is “concerning” that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is “being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan”“The inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of US intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country” said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issueTrump denies

Russian hacking it has been going on for years Serious but hardly news” Cornyn tweeted SaturdayThe Texas Republican seemed to support however a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the US election retweeting the below tweet from Graham “Cyberattacks undermining NATO Ukraine butchery in Syria etc I intend to look at all things Russia – not just election influence”Meanwhile House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday said Sunday he “rejects any politicization of intelligence matters” calling foreign intervention “unacceptable”For the most part other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  Putin’s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton’s campaignAt the same time several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump’s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson ExxonMobil’s chief executive as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin Republicans in a  Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat TillersonThe potential nomination sparked a backlash among the party’s traditional hawks who oppose Putin and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination – requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State“It’s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat” McCain told CBS’s Face the Nation“Being a ‘friend of Vladimir’ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State” Sen Marco Rubio RFla tweeted SundayRepublicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes Over the weekend several committee Democrats including Sens Robert Menendez NJ and Christopher A Coons Del stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidateIn a post on Facebook Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state “alarming and absurd” concluding that “the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President’s Cabinet guiding our nation’s foreign policy”Yet the committee’s chairman Sen Bob Corker RTenn — who was considered a possible pick for Trump’s secretary of state — has said Tillerson would be a good choice“If it is Rex Tillerson he is a very good individual” Corker tweetedShould Tillerson make it to a floor vote Democrats could not block the nomination alone If Democrats stick together Republicans must muster at least  of the  votes they will have to successfully confirm him as Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking voteGraham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination“I don’t know the man much at all but let’s put it this way If you received an award from the Kremlin order of friendship then we’re gonna have some talkin’” Graham said early Saturday morning “We’ll have some

Presidentelect Donald Trump said Sunday that “nobody really knows” whether climate change is real and that he is “studying” whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year agoIn an interview with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace Trump said he’s “very openminded” on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama’s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America’s global competitiveness“I’m still openminded Nobody really knows” Trump said “Look I’m somebody that gets it and nobody really knows It’s not something that’s so hard and fast I do know this Other countries are eating our lunch”There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity — including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation heating and industrial manufacturing — is driving recent climate change In its most recent report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is “extremely likely” that since the  humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the “dominant cause” of the planet’s warming trend The top  hottest years on record have all been since  and  is expected to be the hottest year since formal recordkeeping began in  it’s not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific viewDuring the presidential campaign Trump referred to climate change as a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese a comment he later described as a joke But during a town hall in New Hampshire he also mocked the idea of global warming At that event Meghan Andrade a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters asked Trump what he would do to address the issue to which he replied “Let me ask you this — take it easy fellas — how many people here believe in global warming Do you believe in global warming”After asking three times “Who believes in global warming” and soliciting a show of hands Trump concluded that “nobody” believed climate change was underway except for AndradeDuring Sunday’s interview with Wallace Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their US competitors“If you look at what — I could name country after country You look at what’s happening in Mexico where our people are just — plants are being built and they don’t wait  years to get an approval to build a plant okay” he said “They build it like the following day or the following week We can’t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs”The US has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the  recession though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates Typically economists compare the US against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterpartsThe New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt — a climate change skeptic — as the head Wallace asked whether he was “going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy” to which Trump replied “No No No I don’t want to do that at all  I just want what’s right”“EPA you can’t get things approved I mean people are waiting in line for  years before they get rejected okay ” he said “That’s why people don’t want to invest in this country”It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States’ voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into forceLast week Trump’s transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases such as calculating the social cost of carbon Several scientists federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes officeTrump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings  Play  Trump transition team has issued a list of  questions for the Energy Department asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nations carbon output Whitney ShefteThe Washington PostAt the urging of daughter Ivanka Trump has met in the past week with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio both environmental activists Trump described the sessions as “good meetings” but did not elaborate,Trump says ‘nobody really knows’ if climate change is real,Real
The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudierThe Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a twoday meeting that begins Tuesday and futures markets say there’s a  chance it will follow throughMeanwhile Presidentelect Donald Trump’s fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiouslyFor now economists don’t expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years Even so with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the longterm as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth economists say“Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation” says Tim Duy a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog  Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradualIn November the jobless rate dropped to  from  the previous month That’s already below the  that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation or rapid price increases that decrease consumers purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit marginsThat doesn’t mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spikeWhile an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from  to  annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded that’s well below the Fed’s  targetStill it was the fastest pace in two years And annual wage growth hit a sevenyear high in October and has climbed steadily since early  in “a further signal that inflation is firming” Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clientsIn September Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy “more room to run” without stoking inflation But the labor force shrank in both October and November giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in “If you were to wait any longer you would risk getting behind the curve” says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to China’s slowdown and a sluggish US economy among other factorsThe future roadmap is fuzzier Trump has proposed a  trillion plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and sharp tax cuts a stimulus package that if passed by Congress could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidlyBut “It’s probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast” Duy says It’s similarly too soon he says to anticipate  negative economic fallout from Trump’s restrictive trade proposalsOn the other hand the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up longterm interest rates Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting US exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowingIf they were to persist or intensify next year the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated especially if the faster growth portended by Trump’s plan hasn’t yet materialized Feroli says,Will Trumps plan mean faster rate hikes,Real

Two years ago Jonathan Clark was sending his four schoolage kids to four different schools in Detroit“We were driving  miles a week just to and from school” he said His three oldest – all girls ages  to  – were enrolled at charters privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomesClark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from what’s typical of a public school in Detroit a lack of resources needed to educate students high teacher turnover and low test scores“These are all things they give bad marks to DPS  on” he said “but charters are doing the same”Analysis Trumps cabinet looks increasingly conventional but far from moderateDonald Trump’s personnel picks have stayed within the Republican mainstream – few are Trump cronies and some were even opponents of the presidentelect Read moreThat’s why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trump’s nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of EducationDeVos a billionaire and conservative activist from the state has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choiceDeVos and her husband Dick have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan as well as other sensitive political issues – such as the Michigan legislature’s  decision to pass righttowork legislation The DeVoses have contributed at least  to state lawmakers and Michigan’s GOP party – including support for a failed  effort to pass a proschoolvoucher voter referendum in  education advocates who oppose DeVos’s nomination point to Michigan’s education record – particularly in Detroit where nearly half of students attend chartersSince a quartercentury ago charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state as well as an expansion of school choice Along the way the state’s academic performance has dropped and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impactThough charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters the city’s disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo Just this year the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy – an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit studentsWhat’s more the state’s policies and regulation of charters has been so lax critics routinely refer to the city’s educational landscape as the “wild west” Indeed a federal audit this year noted Michigan’s charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflictofinterest issues The state also allows forprofit charters to be established a practice prohibited elsewhere Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New JerseyFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New Jersey Photograph Mike SegarReutersSince  Detroit’s population has dropped nearly  while its school district’s attendance has plummeted nearly  – a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the cityThe situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the state’s approach – and DeVos’s devotion to maintaining it“It doesn’t matter that charter schools aren’t giving any of the things they promised  years ago” said Stephen Henderson a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press who along with his two children attended charters “She  and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us”But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos In her home state Michigan’s governor and attorney general echoed Trump’s remarks about her qualificationsDan Quisenberry president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies downplayed criticisms of her background saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues“Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults” he said “She’s going to put students and parents ahead of politics”Michigan indeed has some highperforming charter schools including in Detroit Many supporters point to a  Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools with two months of gains or three months in Detroit Still the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform “significantly better” in math and reading than counterparts some even worseThis summer charter school advocates – including DeVos’s group the Great Lakes Education Project – agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a  investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools Schools must now be assessed regularly and new schools accreditedBut a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos“What they feared was the accountability” Henderson  saidDeVos – whose fatherinlaw founded Amway a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for  – has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda After the commission was derailed DeVos donated  to state Republican lawmakers over a two month periodHenderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldn’t donate to their campaign efforts if they didn’t flip their votes on the issueTrump’s transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this storyQuisenberry said critics – namely teachers’ unions – who point to DeVos’ political influence usually “are involved very much in the same influence on the other side”“What the  was about was whose political influence was going to win out” he said “The teachers’ union was very involved”Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city  in his neighborhood there is just one operational school for  kids“If schools in our neighborhood were open and up to standards and producing a quality educational experience then we wouldn’t have had to go to four different schools all over the city” Clark saidClark now sends his three older kids to private school But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city where  of residents live below the poverty line“What about the parents who aren’t in that position”,Trumps choice for education secretary raises fears in Detroit,Real
If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential electionBarack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for MoscowWhile the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in  Wall Street Journal reported “Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson”The  Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals including a  agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant stateowned Russian oil company OAO Rosneft the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobil’s operations overseasTillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the  Sechin sometimes described as the secondmostpowerful man in Russia is now under US sanctions He has said that one of his ambitions is to “ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson”The  ExxonRosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in  following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it  and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be liftedTrump’s choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing itThomas Wright Brookings Institution“We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions” he said at a shareholders’ meetingIn June two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summitIf the sanctions were lifted the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillerson’s retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career“Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it” said Thomas Wright who has written extensively on Trump’s foreign policy at the Brookings Institution“Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe”Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday Trump said “To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well”Lest there be any doubt about which players the presidentelect had in mind Trump added “He does massive deals in Russia not for himself but for the company”‘A culture of intimidation’ Stacks and burnoff from the Exxon Mobil refinery at dusk in St Bernard Parish LouisianaFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stacks and burnoff from the Exxon Mobil refinery at dusk in St Bernard Parish Louisiana Photograph Gerald HerbertAPIn a very real sense Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forcesAs a state it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin“Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude” said Steve Coll who wrote about the company in a book Private Empire“They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too They make people nervous they make people afraid” Coll now a journalism professor at Columbia University told Texas MonthlyRunning the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil however For a start Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate On Saturday leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stoogeThe New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter “Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the president’s cabinet”With a slim  majority it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillerson’s job in doubt He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks led by John McCain“I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin who is a thug and a murderer but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then it’s the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no” the Arizona senator told CNN on SaturdayA US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for RussiaAndrei Kozyrev former Russian foreign ministerMcCain’s former chief of staff Mark Salter was far more blunt on Twitter “Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal Vlad” he wrote “Should be a rough confirmation hearing and a no vote on the Senate floor”Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy He would face a striking culture clash with the institution the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee retired general James Mattis who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscow’s assertiveness in EuropeNevertheless Dmitri Trenin director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center argued “Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war“Not just in USRussian relations a TrumpTillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology”Trenin added “It would be hardnosed and nononsense not averse to the use of force but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat In one word realist”That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers run by strongmen like himselfAndrei Kozyrev a former Russian foreign minister argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for“The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values but that would be a disaster for Russia” said Kozyrev who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington“Why Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine … or in Syria is actually in American values … that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy“The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts If you look at this with a cold eye you say ‘Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine’” Kozyrev said“Look at Syria By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict”,Rex Tillerson an appointment that would confirm Putins US election win,Real
Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the  election to ensure Trump’s victoryFears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus“When the presidentelect’s transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community  it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts” Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee told the GuardianLike his Democratic colleagues on the panel Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators mostly but not exclusively Democrats who consider the Russia hack a national emergencyIt is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concernsOne noted that civilservice laws prevented Trump from launching a purge but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people “who have attended climate change policy conferences”Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new president’s attitudes toward the agenciesThere is not just smoke here There is a  fire the sirens are wailing the Russians provided the lighter fluidGlenn Carle former CIA officer“There is not just smoke here There is a blazing  fire the sirens are wailing the Russians provided the lighter fluid and Trump is standing halfburnt and holding a match” said Glenn Carle a retired CIA officer and interrogator“The facts hurt Trump won’t like the truth and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity”After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidenceOn Friday the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committee’s digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the electionIn response Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments His transition team said in a statement “These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction”Adam Schiff the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee said Trump “cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign” and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence“If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now and demean the hardworking and patriotic Americans who produced it I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths” Schiff said“Will he accept the best insights of our agencies or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions”Trump’s clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in JanuaryShould Trump go through with the reshuffle it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director

intelligence committee said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was “no surprise” He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of “delusions of ‘resetting’ relations with Russia” – a policy that Trump is also pursuingOn Sunday antiTrump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking which they said endangered the country“We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society” the senators said in a joint statement“Democrats and Republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks” Trump reports that Russia influenced US election are ‘ridiculous’Also on Sunday Elijah Cummings the Maryland Democrat on the investigationsheavy House oversight committee pressured the Republican committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to “join us now in our effort to launch a robust and

professional assessment as an intelligence officer Trump has a reflexive defensive monumentally narcissistic personality for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself“He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine He groans with vulnerabilities He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up and he is a shockingly easy intelligence ‘target’ to manipulate”Were Trump an intelligence officer himself Carle said “he

most polarizing Cabinet selections hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird — Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation processAnd Democrats have reason to believe Trumps nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging because according to reports few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with itWhats unusual about Trumps Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics which means that theyre going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation said Simon Rosenberg president of the Democratic think tank NDN Some of them are going to crash Some of them arent going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their backgroundDemocrats will have to pick their battles and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trumps nominees but how vulnerable the nominees are after some diggingRelated Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some RivalsMuch of it depends on whats uncovered in the vetting process said Jim Manley a former aide to Senate

after controversy over his taxes emergedOld domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trumps nominees than personal indiscretions especially given the number of superwealthy candidates Trump has chosenThe Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years Manley said Theyve developed the experience to really pick apart the financialsAnd Trumps team may be flying blind to some extent His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprisesSelecting Rep Mike Pompeo Rkansas as

have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used toThree years ago facing Republican obstruction Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the  votes needed to break a filibuster Republicans need only  votes in the Senate to confirm Trumps Cabinet picksDemocrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trumps nominees and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the causeSome Democrats unsurprisingly are having buyers remorse about the filibuster change including Reids successor as Democratic Leader Sen Chuck Schumer of New YorkI wanted  for Supreme Court and Cabinet but I didnt prevail Schumer told The Washington PostStill he vowed opposition to some nominees however possible If its somebody who is out of the mainstream Schumer said well fight tooth and nail and use every tool we haveThe Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents wishes in filling out their Cabinets approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votesRecent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks if any at all and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past  years according to the Senate historianBut Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans in their view broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general Loretta LynchAnd they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees instead of trying to find common ground in a divided countryDonald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have  percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws Sen Chris Murphy DConnecticut told MSNBC on Friday of Trumps

WASHINGTON — The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clinton’s  presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed and the lawyer who requested it says it offers nothing at all to merit the agencys actions leading up to the Nov  electionThe warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner’s computer might be incriminating to Clinton Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin Under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documentedThe letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected “noncontent header information” suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its alreadycompleted investigation of Clintons private email server The FBI request concludes there is “probable cause to believe” that the laptop contained “evidence contraband fruits andor items illegally possessed” without providing specificsI see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Clinton and Abedin Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY It remains unknown why they thought they might find evidence of a crime why they felt it necessary to inform Congress and why they even sought this search warrant he said I am appalled The FBIs Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking commentClinton campaign officials echoed Schoenbergs complaints Tuesday Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the unsealed filings regarding Humas emails reveals Comeys intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at timeRead moreNew emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probeFBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clintons emailThe FBI concluded in July that there was no “clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws” and that “no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case” Then two weeks before the election Comey sent a threeparagraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that “appear to be pertinent” to Clinton’s private email server Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was “significant”The letter was so vague that Clinton’s opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump including his past treatment of women Trump called it “bigger than Watergate” and predicted that the FBI would right the ship after previously deciding against criminal chargesComey’s investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters who claimed — falsely — that Clinton was guilty of “criminal” activity His large rallies regularly chanted “Lock her up” and Clinton’s motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signsHillary Clinton walks off the stage after speakingHillary Clinton walks off

same time Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid DNev accused him of holding back “explosive” information about Russian interference The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act which prohibits “activity directed towards the success or failure” of a candidateOn Monday former

WASHINGTON — Presidentelect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are jobkilling federal regulations including rules limiting power plant emissions protecting rivers and streams and preventing banks from reckless lendingEasier said than doneThe same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule the “waters of the US” Clean Water Rule or regulations under the DoddFrank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them making quick repeal unattainableIn general rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect In most cases the final rule may not become effective until at least  days after its publication in the Federal Register“The process is laborious but that shouldn’t stop every agency head from setting it in motion” Andy Koenig vice president of policy at the Kochaffiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce wrote in a recent column on the group’s website “The very fact that it is so timeconsuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately”Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulationsSmall businesses can expect policy changes under TrumpBut a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented Overall critics say regulations pose a  trillion drag  on to the US economy every year according to some estimates though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefitsStakeholders have been weighing in about the rules theyd like to see tossedAmong them is the House Freedom Caucus the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison  rules its members view as burdensome costly or unworkable including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches requiring certain animal and plant inspections and development of alternative fuelsDespite some steep hurdles here’s what Trump and Congress can doIncoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effectIt’s standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them said Jerry Ellig senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus CenterPresident Obama did just than when he came into office in  as did his predecessors“If it’s something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isn’t published before Inauguration Day then it’s easy for a new administration to pull those rules back” he saidMany could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports themCongress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered Such “resolutions of disapproval” must be passed and signed within  legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional RecordUnder the Congressional Review Act agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them according to the Congressional Research ServiceThe Mercatus Center lists  Obama administration rules adopted since June  that could be subject to the review act They include rules on implementing school wellness policies regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelinesBut the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trump’s nominees there’s may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback Ellig saidThat hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law  years ago In  Congress and the George W Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplaceAgencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because they’re focused on other priorities Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challengeThat passive approach “is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist” said Lisa Gilbert director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch a government watchdog groupDeciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldn’t guarantee the rule’s demiseAffected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision But it could leave “open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state” Gilbert saidLawmakers could pass a law undoing the ruleThe cleanest — and in many ways steepest — path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just thatThat’s what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administration’s most highprofile regulations such as ones associated with clean water clean power overtime protections the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reformDonald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand RapidsDonald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids Mich on Nov   Photo Paul Sancya APWithin that category there are several approaches using spending bills to insert language known as “riders” preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation using a process known as “reconciliation” to fasttrack bills to undo rules and passing bills through the regular legislative processThat last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibusterNone of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen namely President Obamas deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young childrenTrump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform “Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs and which does not improve public safety and eliminate them”Gilbert with Public Citizen said it’s hard to predict how many of the Obamaera rules will survive“Our success in preserving any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public  what it means to take away these things that are so populist so important” she said “Nobody wants to lose pay raises they’ve already achieved or protections of their health and their air”,Trump’s vow to undo Obama rules Not so fast,Real
WASHINGTON — The very first Presidents Intelligence Checklist — the predecessor to whats now known as the Presidents Daily Briefing — was delivered to President John F Kennedy on a June Saturday in  Typewritten on eight pages of  paper and stamped For the President Only — Top Secret it contained  twosentence briefs culled from diplomatic military intelligence and press sources six shorter notes and maps of Laos and the CongoToday President Obama receives the document on an iPad The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions The maps can be interactive and the briefings can include videoThe differences arent just technological After serving  presidents — and now preparing to brief the  Presidentelect Donald Trump — the Presidents Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decisionmaking styles of each commander in chiefAnd the ways in which its produced read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issuesIt’s the only standing meeting he has every day Even if we don’t have the meeting he gets the document said Obamas deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes Everyday theres the possibility that hell see something that will cause him to move the entire US government in a new direction Theres nothing else like thatFor Obama the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president whos often disdainful of raw unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective He encourages dissenting opinions Hes interested in open source intelligence — including press accounts and increasingly social media — in addition to oldfashioned spycraft and intercepted communicationsPresidentelect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence Hes still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for and catered to Obama Hes reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry TrumanBut Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence For the first month he received inperson intelligence briefings only once a week although his transition team now says its three times a weekBut Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrantI get it when I need it Trump told Fox News SundayI dont have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years he said I dont need that But I do say If something should change let us know In skipping daily briefings Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agenciesAides Trump gets frequent classified briefingsObama has said much the same about his daily briefing — albeit much later in his presidencyOver the years you accumulate knowledge Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year Now Ive got enough of a baseline of knowledge Ive seen problems come up before Ive seen patterns that have emerged I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did  Im skimming Im looking at are there significant differencesThe frequency the duration the format the depth the subject matter — even the distribution list — are all up to the presidentIn a book published earlier this year former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it — and will continue to evolve to meet the presidents personality learning style and prioritiesIf a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance he or she will get that said Priess author of The Presidents Book of Secrets The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessonsThe Presidents Daily Briefing is what its name implies Priess saidIt is brief Everything is not going to make it in It’s daily If it’s not breaking or not current it doesn’t get in he said But the most important word is president Is this deserving of his attentionThats a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues — and for the intelligence community to get to know the presidentelectCurrent and former national security officials say frequent inperson briefings with the president — and the presidentelect — are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is wellinformedThere is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants former CIA director Michael Hayden said In his book Playing to the Edge American Intelligence in the Age of Terror he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the aw s momentMichael Hayden is a retired Air Force fourstar generalMichael Hayden is a retired Air Force fourstar general former director of the National Security Agency and former director of the CIA Photo Jasper Colt USA TODAYIts attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the presidentelects political advisers with a dose of reality Hayden calls it phenomenon of the unpleasant factThats when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration Youre telling them something they don’t want to hear and don’t want to believe he saidAnd its important to do that in an inperson briefing as opposed to the written product You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker Hayden said And you need the ability to do that face to face and to do it with your tone and your words and your body language to communicate as opposed to just throwing it over the transomWhen Obama first took office the intelligence community grumbled that Obama — or at least his national security staff — wanted the reports so brief that they called them PDB haikuHaydens early briefings of Obama he was replaced three weeks into Obamas presidency were far less tactical than the briefings President George W Bush was receivingBut Michael Leiter who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early monthsHis inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy and more about how the US was perceived in the world and interacted in the world he saidBut there certainly was an evolution To me that was most crystallized around the time of underwear bomber he said referring to the Christmas Day  plot to bring down a Detroitbound airliner That so changed the presidents perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these thingsFrom then on he said any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address itStill its a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information — or to attribute more credibility to information only because its classified Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that youre not looking at whats right in front of your eyes Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the electionIt’s worrisome to get into raw intelligence he said Because you may have some intercept that you think is great but it could be some official in some country it could be just their view or what they hope happens Or sometimes they know that the National Security Agency is listening and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence Thats where the job of ODNI is very hardDeputy National Security Adviser for Strategic CommunicationDeputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes Photo Mandel Ngan AFPGetty ImagesODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence an office created by Congress in  in a series of  intelligence reforms While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community the CIA — by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis — still has an outsized role in the processObama has said hes conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts Ive learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic Obama said in the YouTube interview And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same timeBut while Obama says he listens to all voices not all of those voices feel that theyre being heardA  report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that broader community participation in the Presidents Daily Brief PDB remains a challengeRhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lowerlevel analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally — a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carters presidency Lets get the analysts who are living through these issues every day Rhodes said He likes that so hes tried to do that moreThe daily book often contains dissenting views which Leiter said were often the most illuminating thing in a PDB articleAnd under Obama nonurgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president And highly sensitive information gleaned from topsecret sources and methods is balanced with opensource intelligence — the kind of information thats available to anyone reading a newspaperRebalancing the PDBPresidents of course also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities — and that gets reflected in their briefingsRichard Nixons had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China Ronald Reagans was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union And for the last two presidents the Middle East has dominated the PDB — to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider apertureYou could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia Rhodes said To the point where we’ve had to say Hey guys were rebalancing to the AsiaPacific Make sure thats represented in the PDB You almost have to reach out for that stuff because it doesnt always naturally come upObamas PDB also increasingly includes information on economic environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security And theyre not necessarily confined to foreign affairs Last summer deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefingThis Aug   file photo shows a man crossingThis Aug   file photo shows a man crossing the CIA logo in the lobby of CIA headquarters in Langley Va Photo Saul Loeb AFPGetty ImagesWorlds most exclusive newspaperThe Presidents Daily Briefing also known as the book is among the most secret documents the government keeps For a time even its very existence was thought to be classifiedIts just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief it has a sense of urgency and importance — and even mystique — that other top secret documents dont haveToday it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified  briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year The PDB is the most abundantly staffed most deeply sourced daily information

WASHINGTON — President Obama says he has no regrets about his goitalone use of executive power — even if Presidentelect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policiesI think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday If he wants to reverse some of those rules thats part of the democratic processIn his traditional endofyear public radio interview Obama offered a wideranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidencyObama argued that his use of executive action wasnt much different from his predecessors What changed he said is that Congress became less willing to pass legislationCongress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps and the gaps get bigger and bigger because theyre not constantly refreshed and tweaked he said And the bottom line is if you want to rightsize executive power relative to the other branches of government the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislationThe same thing has happened on foreign policy he said The Obama administration has been relying a  congressional war authorization intended for alQaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and SyriaThe danger is that over time Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in he said The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debateBut Obama also said hes installed guardrails on the presidents war powers setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security AgencyYou know there are some critics on the left who would argue we havent gone far enough on that I would argue that weve gotten it about right although Im the first one to admit that we didnt get it all right on day one he said,Trump is within his rights to use executive power Obama says,Real

President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in officeThe Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada These actions and Canadas parallel actions protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth the White House said in a statementThey reflect the scientific assessment that even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the regions harsh conditions is limited the White House added By contrast it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any largescale oil and gas leasing production in the region – at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuelsThis map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activityWhite HouseObamas action designates  Atlantic canyons off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity totaling  million acres according to the administration It provides the same protections to much of the Arctics waters covering the vast majority of US waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas totaling  million acres Canada is doing the same to all Arctic Canadian waters the joint statement addsObama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases But as NPRs Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this actionThe White House says the president is acting within his authority that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this Jeff said on All Things ConsideredThere is no legal precedent for reversal Jeff reports So if theres a legal challenge and Im not going to be surprised if there is one its really not clear what a court would decideThis map shows the area that the US has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasingWhite HouseAs Bloomberg reports the statute doesnt include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through courtEnvironmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling as Jacqueline Savitz the groups senior vice president for the United States said in a statement The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in WashingtonRepresentatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news We think its a very shortsighted decision to take these areas off limits Andy Radford senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute told Jeff the action poses great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country Earlier this year the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalistsThen the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean Last week the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deepsea commercial fishing,Obama Designates Atlantic Arctic Areas OffLimits To Offshore Drilling,Real
Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East Instead it became a day of mourning with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flagdraped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscowbound planeKarlov who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year On Tuesday Karlovs efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia Turkey and Iran — and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle EastThose talks went ahead despite his death Afterward Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the threecountry format the most effective in resolving the Syrian conflict since his talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground Last week the US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for atrocities committed during the Syrian governments assault on the city of AleppoWith a lameduck administration in the White House for the next month Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well Because the Syrian governments retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a weekThats why the reaction to Karlovs murder — by an offduty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself — was practically unanimous in Moscow The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a provocation meant to derail the talksMembers of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in AnkaraWhen Turkey shot down a Russian  warplane along the TurkeySyria border in November  Putins response was fast and furious Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apologyOn Monday the blame in Moscow for the ambassadors killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkeys rapprochement Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigatorsPutin needs Erdogan and Erdogan needs Putin The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires What to do about Syria — once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey — has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisisThe importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogans conciliatory visit to Russia back in August In the space of the past month Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in JanuaryJust a little more than a year ago Putin was accusing Erdogan of a stab in the back and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions — if not billions — of dollarsNow responsibility for Karlovs assassination is being attributed to powers farther afieldMurder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia Media hysteria created conditions for it Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on TuesdayRussian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies didnt shy away from blaming the West directlyTurkey is turning away from the West Thats disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday nightThe European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey he said presenting the West with a formidable counterweight So far Karlovs efforts to that end have not been in vain,After Diplomats Killing Russia Doubles Down On Ties With Turkey,Real
Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over Presidentelect Donald Trump’s secretaryofstate nominee Rex Tillerson in a brewing proxy fight over Trump’s potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policyThe official sparring is expected to take place on Jan  when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a twopart hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobil’s chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to RussiaBut behind the scenes on Capitol Hill the strategizing has already begunDemocrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed But they plan to press the top diplomatdesignate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a “very thorough tough vetting” As they have with Trump Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillerson’s finances as well as his views on critical foreignpolicy mattersIt’s a grilling they would happily give Trump if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committeeAlready the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns Their frustration stems from Tillerson’s response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committee’s prehearing questionnaire According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only “tax return information” for himself and his wife for the previous three years That means it’s possible Tillerson isn’t willing to provide complete returns A battle is brewing over secretary of statedesignate Rex Tillerson’s nomination on Capitol Hill Evan VucciAPDemocrats have demanded that all Trump’s Cabinet nominees release their tax returns — something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign because he said the returns were under routine auditForeign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker RTenn said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats “Unless there was a case where there’s some irregularity that’s known the committee just does not ask for tax returns” Corker said in an interviewCorker said Tillerson is “not going to be the proxy  because we’re not going to ask for tax returns”“I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about Presidentelect Trump not putting his tax returns” Corker said “But that’s not going to change the way we go about our committee process”Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices — particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector They intend to focus on Tillerson’s fourdecade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they — and some Republicans — see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon workMany lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wideranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest Democrats argue Tillerson’s business career raises similar questionsJust how thorny those conflicts may be won’t be clear until the committee receives Tillerson’s financial disclosure statements documents that Corker expects to have before the end of  Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure “as soon as we have it” providing ample time to review what is expected to be a “very extensive” documentCommittee Democrats are planning to scour Tillerson’s financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help according to an aideThe allin effort is vital they argue because unlike many previous secretaries of state Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances If confirmed Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military“This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew” Corker said “Since  will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy a president who hasn’t been involved in foreign policy in his business life we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state”Part of the logic behind planning a twopart hearing one session in the morning and one in the afternoon as Corker put it is so there can be “plenty plenty plenty of time for people to learn everything” they want to from TillersonA particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillerson’s relationship and business dealings with Putin who awarded him the Kremlin’s Order of Friendship in  Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in  as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine arguing that Exxon lost  billion from the policy changeOn Thursday Corker had a  conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia even if he criticized them as Exxon’s CEO“That would be hugely problematic to this one senator if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia” Corker said referring to himself He noted the conversation “alleviated some of the concerns” he harbored about Tillerson’s relationship with the KremlinCorker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin Md also spoke by phone Thursday but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussedOn Tuesday Tillerson was in Washington where he met with Sen Tom Cotton RArk who endorsed his nomination He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination according to the Trump transition team“I think at least I hope that when these meetings take place that we’re going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russia’s malicious activities nefarious activities” Corker said “I got a good sense of how he’d  Russia and Putin and it was certainly different if you will than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne”Several key GOP senators — including John McCain Ariz Lindsey Graham SC and Marco Rubio Fla — have expressed concerns that Tillerson’s ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trump’s seeming affinity for Putin Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to TrumpSince the presidentelect selected Tillerson Trump’s transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates Condoleezza Rice Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillerson’s global bona fides Gates Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a clientOnly one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee — Rubio — has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announcedDemocrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him In the past the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably a procedure that expresses the members’ discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting In  the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagan’s Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee Kenneth Adelman despite his rejection by the panelBut Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committee’s test even if his track record as an oilcompany CEO gives members pause“My sense is based on the conversation we had he’s going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our country’s national interest” Corker said,Senate Democrats plan to run their Trump playbook against Tillerson,Real
There were two notable Trumpworld headlines Wednesday morning One was the news that Corey Lewandowski — Donald Trumps former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job — had just opened a “full service government relations and consulting firm” half a block from the White HouseThe other was that the presidentelect is apparently over “drain the swamp”Thats according to Newt Gingrich a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump“Im told he now just disclaims that” Gingrich said on “Morning Edition” “He now says it was cute but he doesnt want to use it anymore”Gingrich said he had “written what I thought was a very cute tweet about the alligators are complaining but that “somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff”Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp — tweets that apparently earned him the rebukeBut this should really come as no surprise Trump himself has acknowledged his onagain offagain relationship with the phrase And it actually wasnt a mainstay in the campaign until the final daysTrump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase in fact But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace itDrain the swamp We put it in about two days ago I said Drain the swamp I didnt like it I didnt like the expression Drain the swamp in Washington Trump said Oct  at a rally in North Carolina “So I said it three days ago the place went crazy I said You know what Im starting to like that expression And now its a hot — its like trending all over the world”Trump explains why he ‘didn’t like’ the phrase ‘drain the swamp’ but now does  Play  a rally in Kinston NC Oct  thenpresidential candidate Donald Trump said the phrase “drain the swamp” had been “trending all over the world” since he started using it The Washington PostAs admissions of political expediency go this is pretty forthcomingBut its also worth noting here that Trumps flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly Just a day before Gingrichs first tweet above Trump promised in Alabama to “drain the swamp of corruption in Washington DC” He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey Pa the day before thatSo its not clear whether a specific story or cable news item — which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations — might have influenced this change of course if indeed it sticks But whats clear is that Trumps efforts to “drain the swamp” have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments And then there are the many possible conflicts of interest“Saturday Night Live” a couple weeks back featured this wellwritten  Fix newsletterKeeping up with politics is easy nowSign upALEC BALDWINASTRUMP Next Im going to do what I promised to do my whole campaign and I am going to build that swampKATE MCKINNONASKELLYANNE CONWAY Dont you mean drain the swamp and build the wallBALDWINASTRUMP No thats too many things Just smush them togetherThe sketch earned an immediate rebuke from Trump Its not clear whether he objected to this particular passage — his visage was compared in the sketch to a plate of mashed potatoes after all — but you can bet Trump has noticed the derisive coverage of his pledge to “drain the swamp”Heres how Donald Trumps business dealings could shape his presidency  Play  Washington Post explores Donald Trumps transformation from a reality TV star to presidentelect of the United States McKenna Ewen Whitney Shefte Dalton BennettThe Washington PostJust as it was an attractive mantra on the campaign trail its become an easily accessible counterpoint to Trumps ongoing struggles with his business empire conflicts of interest and Cabinet picks that dont really jibe with his promise to shake up WashingtonAnd given that he never really liked the phrase it should be no surprise he might be willing to drop it like a bad habit,Newt Gingrich says Trump is done with ‘drain the swamp’,Real

RALEIGH NC — Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the “bathroom bill” nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it But there’s uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do in part because this Republicancontrolled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way despite intense outside pressure to scrap the lawLegislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill   the “bathroom bill”  which has been blasted by gayrights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday Instead House Republicans returned to a closeddoor meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance which had been the genesis of  Republican repeal supporter Rep Chuck McGrady said “On a difficult issue where the parties don’t have a lot of trust we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte” McGrady tweeted early Wednesday The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their  session’s start was challenged by an opponent of ’s repeal “There is no extraordinary circumstance” said Rep Jeff Collins RNash during a brief debate over session procedures “other than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date” Monday’s action by the Charlotte council was contingent on ’s repeal by Dec   Over the past year there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans Just last week Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Govelect Roy Cooper’s powers in check when he becomes governor Jan  blasted McCrory over House Bill  during the governor’s race and the fallout over the law — job losses canceled concerts and sporting events — contributed to McCrory’s narrow defeat The wideranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildingsGOP Rep Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well“Everybody is acting in good faith in my opinion” McGrady said House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday he saidHowever lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep  in place“We’re sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise commonsense principles like privacy dignity and freedom from our citizens” said Tami Fitzgerald executive director of the North Carolina Values CoalitionHouse Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday saying they “would take up the repeal of ” They also criticized Cooper for taking too much creditThey did not return messages for comment TuesdayCharlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain but the measure enacted Monday notes that it’s dependent on  being repealed in its entirety by Dec  That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal itCooper who helped broker Charlotte’s cooperation with phone calls over the weekend expects a full repeal his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late MondayThe law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state lawThe session is scheduled several days before Christmas with some legislators out of townGOP Rep Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount who voted for  in March told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything “I think we did the right thing the first time” he told the newspaperPassing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support — perhaps  in the Senate or  in the House — if all Democrats voted for itDiscussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year The NBA also moved an AllStar Game out of CharlotteDemocratic Rep Grier Martin of Raleigh said until there’s a full repeal “I’m pretty certain that we’re not going to see another NBA AllStar Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina”LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful“We are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word” said Simone Bell Southern Regional Director for the LGBTrights group Lambda Legal “We want complete and full

HONOLULU  President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of USowned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr Obama’s environmental legacy while also testing Presidentelect Donald Trump’s promise to unleash the nation’s untapped energy reserves The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters subject to periodic reviewMr Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a  law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently The statute says that “the president of the United States may from time to time withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf” Environmental groups hope the ban despite relying on executive powers will be difficult for future presidents to reverse The White House said it’s confident the president’s order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are  canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south Existing leases aren’t affected by the president’s executive actions The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium Mr Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive Mr Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic Mr Obama said just  percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in  and at current oil prices significant production would not occur in future decades “That’s why looking forward we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector” Mr Obama said Still industry officials objected to Mr Obama’s memorandum calling it “last minute political rhetoric” “Instead of building on our nation’s position as a global energy leader today’s unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come” said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America And Alaska Gov Bill Walker an independent said Mr Obama’s move marginalized local voices He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected “To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower  cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard” he said in a statement In issuing a permanent ban Mr Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor Mr Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr Obama’s environmental and climate change actions Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election but Mr Trump’s victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing Mr Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy selfsufficiency  and that it’s time to open up offshore drilling “This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling which promises smaller shortlived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods” said Jacqueline Savitz a senior vice president at the advocacy group Oceana A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr Obama’s decision should they seek to do so The American Petroleum Institute pointed to  when President George W Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries “Fortunately there is no such thing as a permanent ban” said the institute’s Erik Milito But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous “indefinite withdrawals” remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr Obama’s decision will stand Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations “If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obama’s withdrawals he will find himself in court” said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth Frank Knapp president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia said he was “extremely disappointed” in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing tourism and other businesses the region relies upon He’d gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected The decision came as Mr Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama while some Republicans were highly critical “As Presidentelect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections” said Democratic Sen Ed Markey of Massachusetts “The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze” countered Rep Rob Bishop RUtah and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources “This is not a moral calling it’s an abuse of power”,Obama permanently bans drilling in parts of Arctic
